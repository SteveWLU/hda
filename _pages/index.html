          alt="initial-L" style="width:60%">INKING INSTITUTIONS and disciplines,
          the Huon d'Auvergne Digital Archive is a collaborative scholarly project
          that presents for the first time to a modern reading audience the
          Franco-Italian Huon d'Auvergne romance epic. The first phase of the
          project (January 1, 2014 - August 31, 2017), funded by the generosity
          of the National Endowment for the Humanities, develops the first version
          of the Huon digital archive, which includes diplomatic editions of all
          four extant manuscripts, an accompanying English translation, and a
          reading interface that demonstrates protocols for textual analysis and
          comparison of variants. From the initial foundation of phase one, the
          Huon editorial team will build additional functionality involving
          high-resolution scans of the four Franco-Italian manuscripts, creating
          an interactive and linked reading environment. It is our hope that the
          results of phase one will already be useful to researchers, teachers,
          and students of medieval epic. A technical report of the project can be
          found on our <a href="https://github.com/wludh/huon_rails/blob/master/tech-report.md">
          GitHub repository</a>.</p>
