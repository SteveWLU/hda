                <note target="#trans231" type="lex" resp="#SSB">231] If the last word is indeed <hi rend="italic">pis</hi>, then it might imply that the king's desire to bring Berart down specifically is ignoble. However, if there is a missing "r" and the word should be "pris" as in T 230, Huon is noticing the king's skill or valor. Does that mean he doesn't think the king needs his help for he soon switches sides.</note>

The miniatures that depict this disguised devil (61R, 63R, 75V) show him in the typical traveling clothes of a medieval pilgrim. However, the hospitality shown him here obeys the Biblical injunction to show hospitality to a stranger, not only pilgrims.</note>

See Moisan, <hi rend="italic">Répertoire des noms propres</hi>, Tome II Volume 3 (Droz: 1986), p. 872. On the other hand, Huon's next stop is Calabria, so Sicily is more likely the translation.</note>

See other instances at lines 2702, 2890, 7283, 7831 and 8097 (where it is spelled <hi rend="italic">marois</hi>).

In Aspremont, the Old French chanson de geste, the Franco-Italian versions, and Andrea da Barberino’s Aspramonte, he refuses to come to Charles’s aid in southern Italy against a Saracen invasion. When he does come, finally, he rescues the French army. However, he continues to refuse to render homage to Charlemagne, so Charlemagne goes into his territory to besiege him; Charles wins, and Girart dies in a dungeon. Girart is therefore the epitome of a rebel baron refusing Charlemagne’s kingship. Aspremont was extremely popular in Italy.
