                <note target="#trans1" type="ref" resp="#SSB">1] This is a standard opening for lyric poetry, not usually found in epic.</note>
                <note target="#trans51" type="lex" resp="#SSB">51] <hi rend="italic">Marchis</hi> will always be translated as "marquis," which in OF designated the count of a borderland, a "march." Huon is most frequently called a count, but is occasionally called a marquis, a baron or a vassal.</note>
                <note target="#trans168" type="lex" resp="#SSB">168] Although <hi rend="italic">timbre</hi> is used for many different instruments (drum, psaltery, tambourine), I chose "drum" as seemingly most logical for announcing a tournament.</note>
                <note target="#trans175" type="lex" resp="#SSB">175] Gutty gueles, William H. Whitmore, <hi rend="italic">The Elements of Heraldry</hi>  (Rutland VT: Tuttle, 1968), p. 97.</note>
                <note target="#trans189" type="interp" resp="#SSB">189] Huon and the king are watching from the castle the battle between the Auvergnats and the king's men. They don't participate at first in the tournament.</note>
                <note target="#trans210" type="interp" resp="#SSB">210] The expression "les bornes d'Artus" refers to the eastern limits of the known world. See <hi rend="italic">Roman d'Alexandre</hi>, Book 1, line 128.</note>
                <note target="#trans231" type="lex" resp="#SSB">231] If the last word is indeed <hi rend="italic">pis</hi>, then it might imply that the king's desire to bring Berart down specifically is ignoble. However, if there is a missing "r" and the word should be "pris" as in T 230, Huon is noticing the king's skill or valor. Does that mean he doesn't think the king needs his help for he soon switches sides.</note>
                <note target="#trans240" type="interp" resp="#SSB">240] At this point, after Berart's reproach, Huon switches sides and fights alongside the Auvergnats, his men. (In line 140 the king had announced that he wanted Huon on his side, which explains Huon's awkward position. See also lines 221 and 266.)</note>
                <note target="#trans335" type="interp" resp="#SSB">335]It is clear from line 353 in Laisse 13 that the ladies's processions take place on the the second day of the celebrations.</note>
                <note target="#trans358" type="alttrans" resp="#SSB">358] Alternative translation based on <hi rend="italic">se vent</hi> coming from "se vanter": [...] which is worth boasting about.</note>
                <note target="#trans393" type="interp" resp="#SSB">393] A <hi rend="italic">mue</hi> is a cage in which a bird is placed while it molts; this could be a reference to the way women were often enclosed in their own apartments for modesty's sake, which is in itself in keeping with the queen's request that men be kept away while she and her ladies participate in the saint's celebrations.</note>
                <note target="#trans463.1" type="lex" resp="#SSB">463] Literally: [...] not worth a serviceberry (in MF "alise," variously translated as serviceberry, Juneberry, whitebeam berry).

                <note target="#trans571" type="interp" resp="#SSB">571] These two lines are problematic: it isn't clear if <hi rend="italic">sei</hi> is from "savoir" or "estre," and it is also not certain if we should understand the king is talking to himself here about harming Huon and his people or if this is the narrator's voice foreshadowing how the king's men will be harmed for they end up in Hell for carrying out Charles's dastardly plans. </note>
                <note target="#trans638" type="interp" resp="#SSB">638] That is, his fear of her husband.</note>
                <note target="#trans656" type="interp" resp="#SSB">656] The change from singular to plural, which can sometimes be random in this text or attributable to the rhyme position, may simply be a reference back to "her lord's friends" in line 653 above.</note>

The miniatures that depict this disguised devil (61R, 63R, 75V) show him in the typical traveling clothes of a medieval pilgrim. However, the hospitality shown him here obeys the Biblical injunction to show hospitality to a stranger, not only pilgrims.</note>

See Moisan, <hi rend="italic">Répertoire des noms propres</hi>, Tome II Volume 3 (Droz: 1986), p. 872. On the other hand, Huon's next stop is Calabria, so Sicily is more likely the translation.</note>
                <note target="#trans1380" type="lex" resp="#SSB">1380] In this context <hi rend="italic">voir</hi> can't be translated as "truth" which is its most primary meaning.</note>

                <note target="#trans1845" type="interp" resp="#SSB"> 1845] In addition to standards or banners carried into battle (see lines 1748 ff.), a standard might be placed in a camp in a temporary position, usually outside the tent of a commander, and not be carried onto the battlefield. It would also mark the place where commanders would gather to go over strategy and battle plans. Thus it would indicate a gathering spot.

                <note target="#trans2235" type="interp" resp="#SSB">2235] This part of Huon's prayer (through line 2245) resembles the contemporary Universal Prayer (or Prayer of the Faithful), the part of the mass in which the priest lists things to pray for ("intentions") and the faithful respond "Lord, hear our prayer" after each item. See https://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/the-mass/order-of-mass/liturgy-of-the-word/universal-prayer.

See other instances at lines 2702, 2890, 7283, 7831 and 8097 (where it is spelled <hi rend="italic">marois</hi>).

                <note target="#trans9713" type="interp" resp="#SSB">9713] Dares the Phrygian and Dictys the Cretan retold the Trojan War, opposing Virgil's point of view, making Aeneas a traitor.

                <note target="#trans9749" type="interp" resp="#SSB">9749] It is most likely that the <hi rend="italic">a</hi> was misplaced, hence our emendation.

                <note target="#trans9834" type="lex" resp="#SSB">9834] The use of <hi rend="italic">degré</hi> here probably models Dante and his description of the degrees of the circles of Hell. However T 9490 has "scala," "ladder," understanding <hi rend="italic">degré</hi> as a stairway.</note>

It seems irrelevant for this laisse. T is quite similar to B, but the lines are in a different order, still presenting however the same problem. Br and P are different, each speaking of the scholars surrounding Nicomacus coming through the gate.
