                <note target="#trans231" type="lex" resp="#SSB">231] If the last word is indeed <hi rend="italic">pis</hi>, then it might imply that the king's desire to bring Berart down specifically is ignoble. However, if there is a missing "r" and the word should be "pris" as in T 230, Huon is noticing the king's skill or valor. Does that mean he doesn't think the king needs his help for he soon switches sides.</note>
                <note target="#trans240" type="interp" resp="#SSB">240] At this point, after Berart's reproach, Huon switches sides and fights alongside the Auvergnats, his men. (In line 140 the king had announced that he wanted Huon on his side, which explains Huon's awkward position. See also lines 221 and 266.)</note>

The miniatures that depict this disguised devil (61R, 63R, 75V) show him in the typical traveling clothes of a medieval pilgrim. However, the hospitality shown him here obeys the Biblical injunction to show hospitality to a stranger, not only pilgrims.</note>

See Moisan, <hi rend="italic">Répertoire des noms propres</hi>, Tome II Volume 3 (Droz: 1986), p. 872. On the other hand, Huon's next stop is Calabria, so Sicily is more likely the translation.</note>

                <note target="#trans1845" type="interp" resp="#SSB"> 1845] In addition to standards or banners carried into battle (see lines 1748 ff.), a standard might be placed in a camp in a temporary position, usually outside the tent of a commander, and not be carried onto the battlefield. It would also mark the place where commanders would gather to go over strategy and battle plans. Thus it would indicate a gathering spot.

                <note target="#trans1942" type="lex" resp="#SSB">1942] The translation of <hi rend="italic">gesir</hi> is more literally "situation" or "manière d'être" but Huon is clearly referring to his mission.

                <note target="#trans2235" type="interp" resp="#SSB">2235] This part of Huon's prayer (through line 2245) resembles the contemporary Universal Prayer (or Prayer of the Faithful), the part of the mass in which the priest lists things to pray for ("intentions") and the faithful respond "Lord, hear our prayer" after each item. See https://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/the-mass/order-of-mass/liturgy-of-the-word/universal-prayer. Huon, of course, receives an immediate response from God by means of the letter brought by the dove.</note>

See other instances at lines 2702, 2890, 7283, 7831 and 8097 (where it is spelled <hi rend="italic">marois</hi>). In all instances the corresponding line in Turin has some variation of "preda" or "predon" ("stone" related to OF "perron").</note>

Of course, they are being baptized in sea water in this passage, not at a baptismal font as mentioned in the usual terminology. Thanks to PEB for this clarification on baptism.</note>

In Aspremont, the Old French chanson de geste, the Franco-Italian versions, and Andrea da Barberino’s Aspramonte, he refuses to come to Charles’s aid in southern Italy against a Saracen invasion. When he does come, finally, he rescues the French army. However, he continues to refuse to render homage to Charlemagne, so Charlemagne goes into his territory to besiege him; Charles wins, and Girart dies in a dungeon. Girart is therefore the epitome of a rebel baron refusing Charlemagne’s kingship. Aspremont was extremely popular in Italy.
