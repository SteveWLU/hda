                <l n="77">For this reason: the emperor Charles wanted</l>
                <l n="78">The ladies to come with their companions,</l>
                <l n="79">In order to honor the blonde-haired queen,</l>

                <l n="82">To this feast of which we have spoken</l>
                <l n="83">There came such a crowd of people </l>
                <l n="84">That twelve crowned kings were there,</l>
                <l n="85">Handsomely equipped and well-supplied:</l>
                <l n="86">There were dukes, princes, and counts.</l>
                <l n="87">People came from many lands:</l>
                <l n="88">There was the count of Artois and the count of Soissons,</l>
                <l n="89">And from Luxembourg the vassal Merigon;</l>
                <l n="90">There was the count of Auvergne, who brought by his side</l>
                <l n="91">Fair Ynide of the lovely face;</l>
                <l n="92">Also with him he brought Berart, his good cousin,</l>
                <l n="93">And Baudoin the lion-hearted,</l>
                <l n="94">With Thomas of Flanders (both of whom were from</l>
                <l n="95">The same family, as we read):</l>
                <l n="96">Both were brothers of the lovely Ynide,</l>
                <l n="97">Brothers-in-law to the good vassal Huon.</l>
                <l n="98">The count did not come unprepared;</l>
                <l n="99">Rather he had with him at least two hundred companions,</l>
                <l n="100">All of them the best of his household.</l>
                <l n="101">There was Morant, and Samson,</l>
                <l n="102">Who was Count Huon's seneschal.</l>
                <l n="103">They went straight to Paris without stopping,</l>
                <l n="104">And halted in the neighborhood of Saint Paul, </l>
                <l n="105">So we hear. After a while they found </l>
                <l n="106">A lodging that Ynide had been hearing about for some time,</l>
                <l n="107">Which was furnished with both hay and supplies,</l>
                <l n="108">Various provisions, and all kinds of game,</l>
                <l n="109">For the purpose of holding court in honor of the felon king.</l>

                <l n="111">The very one where Count Roland has been.</l>
                <l n="112">To none who came there was it forbidden</l>
                <l n="113">To eat or drink; rather they enjoyed the full hospitality</l>
                <l n="114">That the good duke [Roland] traditionally offered.</l>
                <l n="115">So well did Count Huon maintain [the custom]</l>
                <l n="116">That more than a thousand poor people were fed there everyday.</l>
                <l n="117"><milestone n="2R" unit="fol."/><cb n="a"/>There were others of gentle birth</l>
                <l n="118">Who also hurried to his court</l>
                <l n="119">As if going to the court of the king, or even better.</l>
                <l n="120">He was so much loved by great and small,</l>
                <l n="121">That no one said anything bad about him;</l>
                <l n="122">There was no one who wouldn't willingly suffer or die for him.</l>
                <l n="123">At Pentecost when the guests had eaten and drunk</l>
                <l n="124">At the king's court, and the tables were taken away,</l>
                <l n="125">Charles Martel drew Count Huon aside,</l>
                <l n="126">Along with many others whom he considered his friends:</l>
                <l n="127">"[My] lords," he said, "I am grateful to you all</l>
                <l n="128">For having come here in my honor.</l>
                <l n="129">It has been at least ten years, thanks be to Jesus,</l>

                <l n="132">If such a thing happened, I would have to</l>
                <l n="133">Fight and strike with naked sword.</l>
                <l n="134">Because of the respite we have had,</l>

                <l n="136">For this reason I wish to hold a tournament here</l>
                <l n="137">For four days, in order to teach those </l>
                <l n="138">Who have not struck a blow in battle in a long time. </l>
                <l n="139">I will have them armed on the ramparts.</l>

                <l n="144">What do you say?" And they all answered,</l>

                    him,</l>

                <l n="1019">To tell the truth, he ate that way intentionally,</l>

                <l n="1021">People believed his life to be rather saintly.</l>
                <l n="1022">Everyday when night came he mortified his flesh.</l>
                <l n="1023">It is not up to me to tell about all the good he did,</l>
                <l n="1024">Scarcely anyone would believe what I say;</l>
                <l n="1025">He led a life like a hermit and of great penitence.</l>
                <l n="1026">He said prayers every day; he was never lax in that practice</l>
                <l n="1027">Of saying the Office of the Virgin and doing good works.</l>
                <l n="1028">But I will stop talking of this now, and we'll talk later.</l>
                <l n="1029">When the court finished the meal they washed up.</l>

                <l n="1037">With his barons, who always advised him,</l>
                <l n="1038">He explained the whole affair, he hid nothing from them:</l>

                <l n="1046">It's not worth it, rather it would be harmful;</l>
                <l n="1047">Keep up your spirits as best you can.</l>
                <l n="1048">Pray for me to Jesus, who brought Lazarus back to life,</l>

                    time,</l>

Alternatively, it may be like improvisatory practice where "one singer or group of singers would sing the original chant tune, and the other voices might improvise or sing composed counterpoint above it" and "vocal polyphony was used during mass, often with a low line carrying the chant tune, and upper voices providing counter melodies, improvised or otherwise." Where and when it was done and if the celebrant was involved would be difficult to verify since the specific origin of this story is not known. We thank Remi Chiu, Asst.

                <l n="11187">And [treated] his wife exactly the same way;</l>
                <l n="11188">He spent very little time with her, for he awaited other things,</l>
                <l n="11189">Indeed he knew about this in part, for this reason he was
                    patient,</l>
                <l n="11190">Since he felt Him near, he feared nothing.</l>
                <l n="11191">For this he thanked God who had given him such a gift</l>
                <l n="11192">By means of which He had given him more than he was worthy of.</l>
                <l n="11193">This matter remained just like that </l>
                <l n="11194">Until the day named when the court assembled.</l>
                <l n="11195">A lot of men came there from many places;</l>
                <l n="11196">I'm not able to recount all the names correctly.</l>
                <l n="11197">The pope was there, there were great clergymen:</l>
                <l n="11198">Bishops and archbishops, priests, I believe,</l>
                <l n="11199">And dukes and counts and other noblemen;</l>
                <l n="11200">[And] princes and kings who support Christians.</l>
                <l n="11201">Others came there for the wedding that they expected,</l>
                <l n="11202">And others were inspired by God Almighty,</l>
                <l n="11203">Just as you will hear the matter presently.</l>
                <l n="11204">There were [some] from faraway lands assembling there,</l>
                <l n="11205">Concerning their names I say nothing.</l>
                <l n="11206">The narrative source recounts it rather quickly and briefly:</l>
                <l n="11207">Now let that drop, [my] lords, and listen well.</l>

                <l n="11209">Listen to a song of great renown:</l>
                <l n="11210">This was not a fiction, but proven truth:</l>
                <l n="11211">God performed quite a miracle for Huon,</l>
                <l n="11212">Before he suffered great pain in his life.</l>
                <l n="11213">The major part [of what had happened] wasn't known through [Huon],</l>
                <l n="11214">Concerning this, he wasn't going around lauding it, hardly had he
                    disclosed it [to others].</l>
                <l n="11215">But God now wanted that it be revealed henceforth</l>
                <l n="11216">For the best [man] was of Christendom,</l>
                <l n="11217">Just as you will hear, just as it was encountered;</l>
                <l n="11218">Afterward then I will fall silent for a while.</l>
                <l n="11219">When the time approached for the court to be proclaimed,</l>
                <l n="11220">Huon left his land in good company;</l>
                <l n="11221">His brothers-in-law were there, and of course Berart;</l>
                <l n="11222">Along with them [were] [Huon's] nephews which pleased him a lot,</l>
                <l n="11223">And other men—he chose two thousand of them.</l>
                <l n="11224">They left for Paris without tarrying one bit;</l>
                <l n="11225">I can't recount to you all of their journey.</l>
                <l n="11226">When they arrived at the court, there was already a great assembly of
                    barons;</l>
                <l n="11227">Most of them were staying in tents and pavilions</l>
                <l n="11228">Throughout the area that was densely populated.</l>
                <l n="11229">Because of the great [number of ] people who were amassed there,</l>
                <l n="11230">Who were there outside in this field,</l>
                <l n="11231">The baron said to them, during their council,</l>

                <l n="11233">That the court take place without any delay.</l>
                <l n="11234">Everyone thought it was a good idea;</l>
                <!--NOTE Literally: "To everyone the thing was well-demonstrated -->
                <l n="11235">Each one went there, then it was agreed.</l>
                <l n="11236">The pope had the young woman brought there;</l>
                <l n="11237">He had her placed upon a raised dais.</l>

                <l n="11239">The four wise men got ready then</l>
                <l n="11240">To recount everything that they had done.</l>
                <l n="11241">But the pope spoke before the others;</l>
                <l n="11242">He explained everything to them in a good speech,</l>

                <l n="11244">Thereupon he looked out across the field:</l>
                <l n="11245">Two messengers were coming, quite quickly,</l>
                <l n="11246">One from one direction and the other from the other side.</l>
                <l n="11247">Neither one knew about the other, nor anything of his thoughts;</l>
                <l n="11248">They were on horseback, they were absolutely exhausted.</l>
                <l n="11249">They passed the crowd, they stopped at the dais,</l>
                <l n="11250">That which they had to say, they presented in writing,</l>
                <l n="11251">For they knew little of [the locals'] spoken language.</l>
                <l n="11252">The letters were quickly grasped by the pope;</l>
                <l n="11253">The messengers departed, they were watched by many people.</l>
                <l n="11254">They couldn't be properly greeted by anyone,</l>
                <l n="11255">For no one was able to say where they had gone to.</l>
                <l n="11256">There were quite a few arguments concerning them;</l>
                <l n="11257">Some people praised God, others said completely confidently:</l>
                <l n="11258">"We are certain now that we are bewitched."</l>
                <l n="11259">At that moment then others dropped that affair.</l>

                <l n="11279">The count didn't behave arrogantly because of this;</l>
                <l n="11280">He began at once to weep at that point</l>

                <l n="12094">If they were such as they were supposed to be,</l>

                <l n="12096"><milestone n="83Vb" unit="fol."/>They replied [that] such would be their work.</l>
                <l n="12097">Then you saw all the men weeping;</l>

                <l n="12099">Those who most believed they had erred— </l>
                <l n="12100">It was they who wept the most and were very sorrowful.</l>
                <l n="12101">Now we must tell the story of what happened:</l>
                <l n="12102">Each one deliberately organized his affairs,</l>
                <l n="12103">Then they came to the place where they were disputing.</l>
                <l n="12104">They got into position without noise or cries;</l>
                <l n="12105">You have never seen men of such courage.</l>

                <l n="12111">Each one chose his most worthy [opponent]:</l>
                <l n="12112">King against king, duke against duke, and similarly counts;</l>
                <l n="12113">And prince against prince, commander [against] commander.</l>

                <l n="12116">Once they had done this, they didn't wish to delay any longer;</l>
                <l n="12117">They began to deal blows to each other;</l>
                <l n="12118">They sought each other out a great deal with polished steel swords.</l>
                <l n="12119">They sliced shields and hauberks that were good double-meshed ones;</l>
                <l n="12120">Just as they surrounded some of them, they fell to the ground.</l>
                <l n="12121">They said not a word to each other, but soon they were holding their
                    own,</l>
                <l n="12122">Those who could most [hold their own/ resist], were demonstrating it
                    that day.</l>
                <l n="12123">They did so well that they slew those they encountered,</l>
                <l n="12124">And after two or three, [they kept doing so] as [the Germans] came to
                    attack them.</l>

                <l n="12127">Three [Germans] remained now in the end as I can now recount to

                <l n="12131">When Huon saw him dead, he began to praise God;</l>
                <l n="12132">He cast down his adversary as he made to turn back,</l>
                <l n="12133"><milestone n="84R" unit="fol."/><cb n="a"/>Then he attacked that one who had caused him trouble.</l>
                <l n="12134">He rained blows down on him which finished him off,</l>
                <l n="12135">Then he came back to his companions to seek out battle.</l>
                <l n="12136">That one [whom he fought] was called Thomas of Luxembourg, the
                    warrior,</l>
                <l n="12137">He was count of his land and a very good knight.</l>
                <l n="12138">These two fought, neither one was cowardly;</l>
                <l n="12139">Hour after hour, they were stronger than any wild boars.</l>
                <l n="12140">The dreadful clash of swords between them lasted a very long time,</l>
                <l n="12141">As neither one could overcome the other in anything.</l>
                <l n="12142">If one struck well, the other struck back better.</l>
                <l n="12143">The one didn't see any way to surpass the other;</l>
                <l n="12144">"Hey," said Huon, "Holy Mary, Mother!</l>
                <l n="12145">I see clearly that it is incumbent upon me to die here.</l>
                <l n="12146">Have mercy today on this great sinner:</l>
                <l n="12147">May my soul not be damned in the eternal fire.</l>
                <l n="12148">This is the worst battle that one could ever think to recount,</l>
                <l n="12149">Wherever one might be lost in Hell.</l>
                <l n="12150">The matter is now as it is supposed to be,</l>
                <l n="12151">So that we'll just accomplish what we have set out to do,</l>
                <l n="12152">So long as one of us remains alive intact."</l>
                <l n="12153">With this faith [Huon] attacked [his opponent] fiercely;</l>
                <l n="12154">One [going] at the other without threatening anything.</l>
                <l n="12155">This great clash went on for a long time,</l>
                <l n="12156">But in the end no one was able to boast;</l>
                <l n="12157">They had no weapon left that could vanquish [the other].</l>
                <l n="12158">Their bodies were filling with wounds in many places;</l>
                <l n="12159">The wounds [being] great, their blood started to flow,</l>
                <l n="12160">The guts from both their bodies began to spill out.</l>
                <l n="12161">At that point they had to separate one from the other;</l>
                <l n="12162">Both went to sit on the flat ground.</l>
                <l n="12163">They beat their breasts, they called upon God,</l>
                <l n="12164">That He have mercy on their souls, for they could hold on no
                    longer.</l>
                <l n="12165">Once that was said, there was great weeping;</l>
                <l n="12166">The pope was quickly called there,</l>
