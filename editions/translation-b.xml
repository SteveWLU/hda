                            bears three copies of the coat of arms of the Gonzaga family. The manuscript passed
                            through noble families in the Italian peninsula and then to the English Hamilton
                            family. In the 19th century, the Prussian government bought a group of the Hamilton
                            manuscripts that included B. The manuscript was first described by Adolf Tobler in
                            1884.</p></acquisition>

                <l n="76">Was announced everywhere far and wide</l>
                <l n="77">For this reason: the emperor Charles wanted</l>
                <l n="78">The ladies to come with their companions,</l>
                <l n="79">In order to honor the blonde-haired queen,</l>
                <l n="80"><cb n="b"/>Who would hold court with ladies of
                    renown</l>
                <l n="81">Just like the court the king wished to hold with his barons.</l>
                <l n="82">To this feast of which we have spoken</l>
                <l n="83">There came such a crowd of people </l>
                <l n="84">That twelve crowned kings were there,</l>
                <l n="85">As well as dukes, princes, and counts,</l>
                <l n="86">Handsomely equipped and well-supplied.</l>
                <l n="87">People came from many lands:</l>
                <l n="88">There was the count of Artois and the count of Soissons,</l>
                <l n="89">And from Luxembourg the vassal Merigon;</l>
                <l n="90">There was the count of Auvergne, who brought by his side</l>
                <l n="91">Fair Ynide of the lovely face;</l>
                <l n="92">Also with him he brought Berart, his good cousin,</l>
                <l n="93">And Baudoin the lion-hearted,</l>
                <l n="94">With Thomas of Flanders---both of whom were from</l>
                <l n="95">The same family, as we read---</l>
                <l n="96">Both were brothers of the lovely Ynide</l>
                <l n="97">And were brothers-in-law to the good vassal Huon.</l>
                <l n="98">The count did not come unprepared;</l>
                <l n="99">Rather he had with him at least two hundred companions,</l>
                <l n="100">All of them the best of his household.</l>
                <l n="101">There was Morant, and Samson,</l>
                <l n="102">Who was Count Huon's seneschal.</l>
                <l n="103">They went straight to Paris without stopping,</l>
                <l n="104">And halted in the neighborhood of Saint Paul, </l>
                <l n="105">So we hear. After a while they found </l>
                <l n="106">A lodging that Ynide had been hearing about for some time,</l>
                <l n="107">Which was furnished with both hay and supplies,</l>
                <l n="108">Various provisions, and all kinds of game,</l>
                <l n="109">For the purpose of holding court in honor of the felon king.</l>

                <l n="111">The very one where Count Roland has been.</l>
                <l n="112">To none who came there was it forbidden</l>
                <l n="113">To eat or drink; rather they enjoyed the full hospitality</l>
                <l n="114">That the good duke [Roland] traditionally offered.</l>
                <l n="115">So well did Count Huon maintain [the custom]</l>
                <l n="116">That more than a thousand poor people were fed there everyday.</l>

                <l n="118">Who also hurried to his court</l>
                <l n="119">As if going to the court of the king, or even better.</l>
                <l n="120">He was so much loved by great and small,</l>
                <l n="121">That no one said anything bad about him;</l>
                <l n="122">There was no one who wouldn't willingly suffer or die for him.</l>
                <l n="123">At Pentecost when the guests had eaten and drunk</l>
                <l n="124">At the king's court, and the tables were taken away,</l>
                <l n="125">Charles Martel drew Count Huon aside,</l>
                <l n="126">Along with many others whom he considered his friends:</l>
                <l n="127">"[My] lords," he said, "I am grateful to you all</l>
                <l n="128">For having come here in my honor.</l>
                <l n="129">It has been at least ten years, thanks be to Jesus,</l>

                <l n="132">If such a thing happened, I would have to</l>
                <l n="133">Fight and strike with naked sword.</l>
                <l n="134">Because of the respite we have had,</l>

                <l n="136">For this reason I wish to hold a tournament here</l>
                <l n="137">For four days, in order to put to the test those </l>
                <l n="138">Who have not struck a blow in battle in a long time. </l>
                <l n="139">I will have them armed on their horses with flowing manes.</l>
                <l n="140">In my company [will be] the mighty Lord Huon</l>

                <l n="144">What do you say?" And they all answered,</l>

                <l n="163">There were a hundred counts desiring</l>

                <l n="875">But God knows the truth and sees my fidelity</l>
                <l n="876">And knows I concealed it all from my own dear lord</l>
                <l n="877">Because I didn't want at that time to cause hostility between them.</l>
                <l n="878">Whatever may be the result, I will ask him now</l>

                <l n="891">They spoke about it and begged him so repeatedly</l>
                <l n="892">That he promised them to do what they wished.</l>
                <l n="893">Then they were reassured, and he sent for his council.</l>

                <l n="900">Then it will be necessary for me to leave on the king's business</l>

                <l n="902">At that moment, when I will be separated from you,</l>

                <l n="1134">He saw her face splotched with the tears she had shed;</l>

                <l n="1482">At this response, several of them lost control</l>

                <l n="1484">Like a man of prowess and valor.</l>
                <l n="1485">He hastened toward them; he lost no ground at all;</l>

                <l n="1494">So he held back and drew himself back to one side</l>
                <l n="1495">And called out to them, "What are you doing, you scoundrels?</l>

                <l n="1503">Or indeed, if you prefer war, I cannot do otherwise than grant you
                    that."</l>

                <l n="1505">They cried out to him as loudly as they could:</l>
                <l n="1506">"Do whatever you wish with us, good sir;</l>
                <l n="1507">We declare ourselves your men from this very moment</l>

                <l n="1510">And Huon answered, "Will you thus swear to me</l>

                <l n="1516">And they thanked him and then swore an oath.</l>

                <l n="2722">They themselves were not conscious at all;</l>

                <l n="2731">The young ladies recovered from their fear.</l>
                <l n="2732">They recovered consciousness, their color returned.</l>
                <l n="2733">It was obvious that they were afraid:</l>
                <l n="2734">In honor of holy God, they bowed down to the earth,</l>
                <l n="2735">Striking their chests and beating their breasts harder,</l>
                <l n="2736">And after that they began to weep uncontrollably.</l>
                <l n="2737">So much did they lament and weep that Huon was overcome with tender
                    pity;</l>
                <l n="2738">He watched for a long time how they demonstrated their grief.</l>
                <l n="2739">Soon he comforted them and said out of [brotherly] love,</l>

                <l n="2741">Pay attention to other things that might be better tasks;</l>
                <l n="2742">You will never gain anything from such sorrowing.</l>

                <l n="2747">Because they saw him holding weapons;</l>
                <l n="2748">They were truly very frightened of him.</l>
                <l n="2749">So the good count did all he could to reassure them:</l>

                <l n="2783">That he made her forget Muhammad and Tervagant</l>
                <l n="2784">And believe in Jesus Christ. Then she asked for baptism.</l>
                <l n="2785">The count repeated to her, "Do you believe this sincerely,</l>

                <l n="2788">So the count said to her, "You have good sense."</l>

                <l n="3279">In that place a devil had been imprisoned for a long time.</l>
                <l n="3280">Many a day had he been there, through many long seasons;</l>
                <l n="3281">I'll tell you more about his behavior now:</l>
                <l n="3282">By night and by day he had suffered great afflictions,</l>
                <l n="3283">He had been condemned to a stone block.</l>
                <l n="3284">From his voice, [he seemed to be] giving a sermon,<note xml:id="trans3284"/></l>
                <l n="3285">It sounded like he was reading and reciting prayers,</l>
                <l n="3286">But no one could understand what he said.</l>
                <l n="3287">When Huon heard him, he immediately stopped</l>
                <l n="3288">And said to his company, "Let's not move forward another step.</l>
                <l n="3289">This is a hermit, a man of good intentions.</l>
                <l n="3290">He has freely remained thus for a long time,</l>
                <l n="3291">And leads a holy life, so we believe;</l>
                <l n="3292">He never stops reading and saying prayers.</l>
                <l n="3293">Let's stay in this area, let's not disturb him.</l>
                <l n="3294">If it pleases God, we will all be better thanks to his life."</l>
                <l n="3295">But if he knew completely the true nature of the felon,</l>
                <l n="3296">The good baron would have thought to do otherwise.</l>

                <l n="3297">Count Huon sheltered in this lair,</l>
                <l n="3298">And he firmly admonished his companions</l>
                <l n="3299"><milestone n="23V" unit="fol."/><cb n="a"/>That they were not to bother the hermit

                <l n="3300">If they could learn anything from the words he said,</l>
                <l n="3301">Then they would take it for it would do great good.</l>
                <l n="3302">Then they ate what they found;</l>
                <l n="3303">Night fell and they lay down to sleep,</l>
                <l n="3304">And the lion, because the pit was there,</l>
                <l n="3305">Left the lair [and] settled down just outside.</l>
                <l n="3306">He made a sign to the count that they were badly lodged,</l>
                <l n="3307">But [Huon] didn't understand him at all, he entered feeling safe;</l>
                <l n="3308">He wanted to bring [the lion] with him, [but] he went the other way.</l>
                <l n="3309">The count thought that [the lion] would guard the entrance;</l>
                <l n="3310">With that he let the lion be and went to lie down;</l>
                <l n="3311">May God take throught for them; [Huon] has found the devil</l>
                <l n="3312">Who has no judgement or, indeed, abstinence.</l>
                <l n="3313">He could quickly fall, he would consider himself wretched,</l>
                <l n="3314">But God was with them, for Huon frequently called to Him</l>
                <l n="3315">With all that he ever did or said.</l>
                <l n="3316">At that moment he crossed himself and said many good prayers:</l>
                <l n="3317">He began a psalm which David had pronounced,</l>
                <l n="3318">"<hi rend="bold">Set me, O Lord, a law</hi>," and then he finished it,<note xml:id="trans3318"/></l>
                <l n="3319">Then he began another, "<hi rend="bold">Praise the Lord, you that are his servants</hi>,"<note xml:id="trans3319"/></l>
                <l n="3320">And "<hi rend="bold">Let the whole earth praise</hi>, for all He does for us,"<note xml:id="trans3320"/></l>
                <l n="3321">As long as he knew how to say it well he never stopped</l>
                <l n="3322">Until midnight when he fell asleep.</l>
                <l n="3323">He slept a little bit there, he tossed and turned with worry;</l>
                <l n="3324">He saw a great vision, he didn't know what it meant.</l>
                <l n="3325">He remained that way until the morning,</l>
                <l n="3326">Whereupon he said his prayers and crossed himself.</l>
                <l n="3327">For a long time he heard the voice murmuring over there,</l>
                <l n="3328">But he didn't understand it at all; he didn't know his language.</l>
                <l n="3329">Indeed he truly believed that it was a good thing,</l>
                <l n="3330">He very much feared disturbing him.</l>
                <l n="3331">In this way nine days passed,</l>
                <l n="3332">But on the tenth day the count reflected further about it,</l>
                <l n="3333">Because of the lion who still wouldn't come in at all.</l>

                <l n="3338">I believed that he stayed outside to stand guard.</l>
                <l n="3339">Many times I have heard it said that beasts have such an ability:</l>
                <l n="3340">If they sense something supernatural,</l>
                <l n="3341">If it is something evil, they offer up a great prayer.</l>
                <l n="3342">Here inside this cave I have been hearing this voice continuously for
                    days,</l>

                <l n="3344">Nor can one pick out a single word.</l>
                <l n="3345">And many times I have gone over there to listen,</l>
                <l n="3346">I have never seen him move or go [anywhere].</l>
                <l n="3347">I'm afraid that he might be the devil,</l>
                <l n="3348">That he is here to deceive us.</l>
                <l n="3349">I'll say one thing: I intend to go test him.</l>
                <l n="3350">Before I leave, I will beg</l>
                <l n="3351">That he speak more clearly to me.</l>
                <l n="3352">And if he doesn't want to do it,</l>
                <l n="3353">I'll make him do it, if I can find a way.</l>
                <l n="3354">Come to me, don't be afraid at all.<note xml:id="trans3354"/></l>

                <l n="3357">Then the count placed his hand in his bag,</l>

                <l n="3360">When he unwrapped it, it cast such light</l>
                <l n="3361">That he saw clearly in front [of him] as far as a bow shot.</l>
                <l n="3362">When the devil saw this, he began to cry out:</l>

                <l n="3364">I cannot look at what you have in your hand!</l>

                <l n="12125">But in the end no one could boast,</l>
                <l n="12126">For everyone would die before sunset.</l>
                <l n="12127">Three remained now behind as I can now recount to you,</l>
                <l n="12128">One of these killed Thomas, the good warrior,</l>
                <l n="12129">Brother-in-law to Count Huon, who was very noble and proud;</l>
                <l n="12130">Another killed Berart, which grieved Huon greatly.</l>
                <l n="12131">When Huon saw him dead, he began to praise God;</l>
                <l n="12132">He cast down his own opponent, he made him fall back,</l>
                <l n="12133"><milestone n="84R" unit="fol."/><cb n="a"/>Next he attacked the one who had caused [Berart] trouble.</l>
                <l n="12134">He rained blows down on him until he finished him off,</l>
                <l n="12135">Then he came back to his counterpart to demand battle.</l>
                <l n="12136">That one [whom he fought] was called Thomas of Luxembourg, the warrior,</l>
                <l n="12137">He was count of his land and a very good knight.</l>
                <l n="12138">These two fought, neither one was cowardly;</l>
                <l n="12139">Hour after hour, they were stronger than any wild boar.</l>
                <l n="12140">The dreadful clash of swords between them lasted a very long time,</l>
                <l n="12141">As neither one could overcome the other in any way.</l>
                <l n="12142">If one struck well, the other struck back better.</l>
                <l n="12143">The one didn't see any way to surpass the other;</l>
                <l n="12144">Huon said, "O Holy Mother Mary!</l>
                <l n="12145">I see clearly that it is incumbent upon me to die here.</l>
                <l n="12146">Have mercy today on this great sinner:</l>
                <l n="12147">May my soul not be damned in the eternal fire.</l>
                <l n="12148">This is the worst battle, I do believe,<note xml:id="trans12148"/></l>
                <l n="12149">Than when I was lost in the infernal dwelling place.</l>
                <l n="12150">Now let the matter go as it is supposed to go,</l>
                <l n="12151">For we'll really accomplish what we've set out to do,</l>
                <l n="12152">Which is that at least one of us remain alive."<note xml:id="trans12152.1"/><note xml:id="trans12152.2"/></l>
                <l n="12153">At that moment [Huon] attacked him fiercely.</l>
                <l n="12154">Each one without threatening the other at all<note xml:id="trans12154"/></l>
                <l n="12155">Endured this great clash for a long time,</l>
                <l n="12156">But in the end no one was able to boast about it;</l>
                <l n="12157">They had no arms left that could protect them.</l>
                <l n="12158">Their bodies were filling with wounds in many places;</l>
                <l n="12159">The wounds [being] great, their blood started to flow,</l>
                <l n="12160">The guts from both their bodies spilled out.</l>
                <l n="12161">At that point they separated one from the other;</l>
                <l n="12162">Both went to sit on the flat ground.</l>
                <l n="12163">They confessed their sins, they began to call upon God</l>
                <l n="12164">To have mercy on their souls, for they could hold on no longer.</l>
                <l n="12165">At these words, there was a great amount of weeping;</l>
                <l n="12166">Right away the pope came to them</l>
                <l n="12167">And other wise men rushed to adjudicate</l>
                <l n="12168">Between the two champions whom they saw on the ground,</l>
                <l n="12169">Since he had to speak to them.<note xml:id="trans12169"/></l>

                <l n="12179">They looked at the wounded men who lay on the field;</l>
                <l n="12180">They found everyone dead, their faces pallid and gray,</l>
                <l n="12181">Except for Huon's counterpart who was not yet dead,</l>

                <l n="12183">With good knowledge they could make a decision,</l>
                <l n="12184">Since one heard nothing from them---they didn't speak or say anything---</l>
                <l n="12185">This was what was conclusive for the judgment</l>
                <l n="12186">[And] how the legal decision truly went at that time:</l>
                <l n="12187">They gave the victory to the Germans,</l>
