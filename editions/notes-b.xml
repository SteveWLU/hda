However, see <hi rend="italic">empir</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Prise de Pampelune</hi> (v. 4970) and the many other variants. As one of the most frequent words in epic vocabulary, it is greatly varied in rhyme. Furthermore, in Italian, "empio" means "irreligioso, sacrilego, profanatore" and "spietato, crudele" (Zingarelli) so while there is the hint of emperor, there is also the sense of merciless, sacrilegious ruler.</note>

                <note xml:id="b977" type="interp" resp="#LZM"><hi rend="italic">hair</hi>: this could be haïr, anger, but we are interpreting it as "air" to go with the Turin reading and also the sense here: out the window and into the air, the sky.</note>
                <note xml:id="b1149" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> <hi rend="italic">la</hi> is almost unreadable in the manuscript. It is unclear whether this was intentional or not on the part of the scribe or was done later; it seems to be something painted over those letters, but similar to a spot on the left side of the page of a chocolate or cafeaulait color.</note>
                <note xml:id="b1152" type="codic" resp="#LZM">Catchword at the bottom of the page, almost entirely washed out:<hi rend="italic">si</hi> </note>

                <note xml:id="b1250" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> Between lines 1249 and 1250 in column 9va, running into the right margin is a line with an "x"; also at the bottom of column 9va, there is a line with a corresponding "x" in the left margin. Since the column is one line too long in comparison to the other, and normally the columns are equal, this final line (1264) is clearly to be moved to the position between 1249 and 1250.</note>
                <note xml:id="b1361" type="interp" resp="#JVC"><hi rend="italic">Sir</hi> désigne la ville de Tyr, puisque les tissus d'Orient étaient réputés et [...] l'on indique volentiers une ville d'Orient comme lieu d'où provient un tissu précieux. ("Sir" refers to the city Tyre, since oriental fabrics were famous and a famous city of the East is frequently used as a source for a valuable fabric (trans. LZM)).</note>
                <note xml:id="b1399" type ="interp" resp="#LZM"> MS:<hi rend="italic">ma[n]dana</hi>, however it seems most likely to be an error for "via[n]da na"; cf. line 6181 <hi rend="italic">viande n'a</hi>.</note>

                <note xml:id="b1643" type ="interp" resp="#LZM"> The rhyme here is normally a diphthongue but the simple past of <hi rend="italic">oïr</hi> is bisyllabic, so the editor must choose between the rhyme spellings or the usual representation of the simple past of this verb. See also 8160, 11274.</note>
                <note xml:id="b1667"  type = "ling" resp="#LZM"> In the rhyme position, the verb "savoir" takes this unusual form.</note>

Alternatively it could be <hi rend="italic">v'oit trainé</hi>, "the kings had there dragged before them"</note>
                <note xml:id="b1749"  type ="codic" resp="#LZM"> The MS is damaged at this point and extremely difficult to read. T: <hi rend="italic">morty zasere al sabione</hi> [dead men lying on the sand]. If the reading here were similar, it might be <hi rend="italic">hon veit sor ce gravois</hi>; but the two are not always parallel. <hi rend="italic">Gravoy</hi> appears appears five times, <hi rend="italic">gravois</hi> once, in this text, meaning "sand" or "gravel" in some way (path, etc.) in this MS.</note>
                <note xml:id="b1753" type="codic" resp="#LZM">The beginning of this column is faded in parts, though the outlines of strokes are clear. For multiple minims, there can always be doubts, but in searching other F-I texts there are no forms of <hi rend="italic">sui-</hi> for the verb "to follow," whereas there are 68 forms of <hi rend="italic">siv- </hi> attested in FIOLA. RIALFrI however, offers both. In this text there are 3 other forms with <hi rend="italic">siv-</hi>, one <hi rend="italic">seut</hi>, but none with <hi rend="italic"> sui-</hi> unless the minims are reconstrued in those appearances as well, thus <hi rend="italic">siveç</hi> here, though the connectors are in fact <hi rend="italic">suiveç.</hi> </note>

J.-C. Vallecalle suggests that it might have been an <hi rend="italic">a</hi> there [possibly scraped off?], making the line read <hi rend= "italic">Posible çonse il fust, bien le sai a fi,</hi> that is, "This [Huon's mission in Hell] would be possible, I know certainly (... if Hell were built on earth)."</note>
                <note xml:id="b2130"  type="interp" resp="#LZM"> <hi rend="italic">gieter </hi> may have been the original reading of the text, for "how to shoot a bow".</note>

                <note xml:id="b2412"  type="interp" resp="#LZM"><hi rend="italic">aveit a bone foy</hi>seems to be a MS error with either an extra<hi rend="italic">a</hi>(he had good faith or he went in good faith) or perhaps a <hi rend="italic">u</hi> for an <hi rend="italic">n</hi> (<hi rend="italic">aneit </hi> as some form of "andare"), though there is no such form listed in RIALFrI for other Franco-Italian texts.  </note>

                <note xml:id="b9915" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> The illumination at the bottom of this page is of a city with five towers visible, a figure in red (with head covering) at the top of the first gate on the left, nearest the three visitors who are at the far left. The gate figure holds a book with black dots to represent writing on it. Note that the tower is square, suggesting that "reont" refers to something else. <hi rend="italic">Charere</hi> (line 9915) means both "chair" (<hi rend="italic">cattedra</hi> in MSI) and "highway" in this text, as confirmed by other Franco-Italian texts. In fact, the gateway is rounded and the human figure is at the highest point. Since this is a scholar with a book, it makes the most sense for him to be in a chair or seat.  The portion remaining in the Turin MS (folio 146R) shows a loggia with rounded openings to the left of the illumination, with the three travellers outside to the left. One figure inside (with a fancy headdress) is on a chair with a baldacchino in a polygonal shape (not quite a circle, but circular) above. Since the walls in the Berlin MS illumination reach outside the frame, there is nothing above the figure who is on top of the gate there. It is unclear therefore whether the Turin version is a variation of meaning, but in any case, it is one possible explanation of <hi rend="italic">reont</hi>.</note>

                <note xml:id="b10329" type="interp" resp="#LZM">Tisiaus: Tisias is reported to have been the first theoretician of rhetoric in ancient Greece. It is taken that he was the student of one Corax, who has left no written work. Tradition has it that, after the fall of the monarchy in Sicily in the 5th c. BCE, the rise of democracy occasioned a need for persuasive speech (command no longer being accepted). One successful Sicilian practitioner was Gorgias who went to Athens in 427 BCE, where he became a major figure among the Sophists. In the <title rend="italic">Gorgias</title>, Plato accused rhetoricians of favoring opinion over truth, success in the moment over enduring verities. (See also <title rend="italic">Phaedrus</title> 267a-b.) Thus, in the history of rhetoric, Tisias would stand in the same relationship to rhetoric as the Sophists to sophistry. Support for this view comes in the theory that Corax was not a separate person, but that the word, which means "crow" is actually a derogatory nickname for Tisias himself. Rhetoric received a higher standing with Aristotle, fascinated with how things break down into their component parts, who wrote his <title rend="italic">Rhetoric</title> as an analytical guide to, and practical manual for, the art—but he distinguished it from logic (dialectic).  In the later Middle Ages, therefore, Tisias may be taken as a mythical founder, an archetype for all who indulge in untruth for  emotional effect. Whatever his reputation in antiquity, in this passage, Berlin, lines 10324-10351, Tisias seems to represent all seven liberal arts (10328). The reference to his singing includes another of the seven: grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.
