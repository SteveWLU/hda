<note target="#b1" type="trans" resp="#LZM">1] Holtus ("Considerazioni") published lines 1-109; his edition is a diplomatic one (45-48), with abbreviations reproduced and word divisions as in the manuscript. Tobler published lines 1-111 (pp. 617-19); he reproduces the text without punctuation other than the final periods and the lines that mark caesura here at the beginning of the poem, and without distinguishing u/v.</note>
<note target="#b12" type="codic" resp="#LZM">12] MS: une (final -e is expunctuated)</note>
<note target="#b21" type="edit" resp="#LZM">21] The initial here is very faded; the external background is gold, the internal illustration is red with a figure inside, so the original would seem to be blue, though it is currently faded and purplish.</note>
<note target="#b55" type="codic" resp="#LZM">55] MS: quilens with "il" expunctuated</note>
<note target="#b76" type="trans" resp="#LZM">76] Tobler omits the superscript after ".iiii."; Holtus seems to have a small "m" over the roman numeral. This MS abbreviation appears only with ".iiii." (six times) and would seem to be validated by line 6271, when in a prayer Christ arose after 4 days; and in line 11057, where four men are chosen as electors for the king to replace Charles Martel, and listed immediately thereafter. Furthermore, the "m" in lines 9334 and 11496 has no final upstroke.</note>
 <note target="#b86" type="interp" resp="#LZM">86] <hi rend="italic">ster</hi>: seems to here be a conjugated verb. Cf forms <hi rend="italic">stent</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ster</hi> (these last as infinitives) in the poem.</note>
 <note target="#b97" type="lex" resp="#LZM">97] <hi rend="italic">sorage</hi>: 'brother-in-law' (T-L serorge)</note>
<note target="#b106" type="edit" resp="#LZM">106] T 106: <hi rend="italic">una chasa che Ynida l</hi>a vite de longo, which might make more sense, "that Ynide saw from afar."</note>
<note target="#b109" type="trans" resp="#LZM">109] End of Holtus's diplomatic transcription ("Considerazioni").</note>
<note target="#b111" type="trans" resp="#LZM">111] End of Tobler's edited selection.</note>
<note target="#b136" type="edit" resp="#LZM">136] All text that is written above the line in the original is enclosed in parentheses in this transcription.</note>
<note target="#b139" type="edit" resp="#LZM">139] MS is missing a word for "horse"; since the phrase is a fixed formula (see lines 1182, 7290, 7297), here we insert "civals" to accord with two of the other three uses of "crenu" and its forms. "Destrer" would be another possibility.</note>
<note target="#b167" type="interp" resp="#LZM">167]There seems to be a problem with this line. In B "lou" normally means either 'place' (MSF lieu) or 'the' (MSF le).  Here, however, a verb seems to be missing; perhaps, similarly T 168: luy et Ugon, this should be "lu o," 'he with'.</note>
<note target="#b168" type="interp" resp="#LZM">168]<hi rend="italic">timbre</hi>: this is a psaltery, not what one normally expects for a call to fight. Perhaps there is a metathesis of the "r" for  "t[r]ombe"; T 169: <hi rend="italic">el feze i lifante e le c</hi>inbale sonare </note>
<note target="#b200" type="interp" resp="#LZM">200] This line is problematic for sense; the Turin version is also unclear.</note>
 <note target="#b231" type="interp" resp="#LZM">231] <hi rend="italic">pis</hi>: the reading is clear in the MS; yet see T 230: <hi rend="italic">fora solamente qu</hi>ando el vole dal re lo presio [except when he saw the valor of the king].</note>
<note target="#b234" type="interp" resp="#LZM">234] T 233 does not include this wording:  <hi rend="italic">anzé se fereno</hi> de coro e de fede [they hit each other spiritedly and in good faith].</note> 
<note target="#b245" type="codic" resp="#LZM">245] MS: revser</note>
<note target="#b320" type="interp" resp="#LZM">320] <hi rend="italic">engoler</hi>: Cf. Holtus <hi rend="italic">Aliscans</hi> v. 7560.</note>
<note target="#b339" type="interp" resp="#LZM">339] en gajer: en gage, as security, in case of misbehavior.</note>
<note target="#b343" type="edit" resp="#LZM">343] MS: nolōs. This is an interesting slip: <hi rend="italic">non</hi> added to a form of <hi rend="italic">voloir</hi> or perhaps merely a saut du même au même (two strokes plus 'o': <hi rend="italic">no volons</hi>, but an extra syllable is not needed here).</note>
 <note target="#b402" type="lex" resp="#LZM">402] <hi rend="italic">vancel</hi>: see T-L vanerie; cf. Petit Robert <hi rend="italic">vanne</hi> (dated 1274).</note>
 <note target="#b405" type="interp" resp="#LZM">405] For the forms <hi rend="italic">glese, glesse, glesie</hi>, see Holtus (<hi rend="italic">Lexikalische</hi>, p. 341).</note>
<note target="#b415" type="edit" resp="#LZM">415] MS: ia belist. <hi rend="italic">belist</hi> is a hapax. Elsewhere in the text, we find <hi rend="italic">l'abelist</hi>, e.g., 4169, 6321, etc.</note>
 <note target="#b498" type="lex" resp="#LZM">498] <hi rend="italic">gamentoit</hi>: Cf. <hi rend="italic">Entrée d'Espagne</hi>, <hi rend="italic">gaumenter</hi> (T-L gaimenter), but also 9746 here, "gamenta de soit," 'he complained of thirst'. It is possible that this is a combination of "gemere" (to weep, lament) that DELI dates before Dante, before 1321, plus "lamentare," or possibly with a frequentative created on "gemito," the past participle of "gemere."</note>
<note target="#b508" type="edit" resp="#LZM">508]There is a "+" in the right margin in light brown ink, perhaps inserted by a nineteenth-century reader.</note>
<note target="#b533" type="interp" resp="#LZM">533] MS: hastivement: there seems to be a problem with the tradition at this point; T reads (according to Rajna) "<hi rend="italic">studevelmente</hi>."</note>
<note target="#b542" type="codic" resp="#LZM">542] MS: gamēt, with a side-ways "u" over "g" toward the "m"</note>
<note target="#b610" type="interp" resp="#LZM">610] Alternate reading: si l'afier spiera, "if they suspect the affair/event"; cf. T 605: se l'afar spiarà.</note>
<note target="#b669" type="edit" resp="#LZM">669] MS missing the abbreviation mark here in <hi rend="italic">acoplir</hi>; cf. Vv. 1271, 1282, etc.</note>
<note target="#b674" type="edit" resp="#LZM">674] The MS is difficult to read: 'r' of <hi rend="italic">complira</hi> is unclear. It would seem that there is something above the line, but the section is faded. Turin, v. 669: <hi rend="italic">acompirà</hi>.</note>
<note target="#b704" type="interp" resp="#LZM">704] There seems to be a problem in these lines. It may be a case of saut de même au même, with "re" omitted; compare Turin line 702. In T 696, the verb is in the second plural, and "vuy" is the subject: <hi rend="italic">vuy dovite</hi> esere signore lo mazore.</note>
<note target="#b715" type="interp" resp="#LZM">715] <ex rend="angle">la</ex> added for sense and syllable count; cf. T: 709 <ex rend="italic">lizeramente la</ex> porite vuy possa avere.</note>  
<note target="#b751" type="codic" resp="#LZM">751] p<hi rend="italic">re</hi>gant: the "g" has an unusual form; it looks more like a "y"</note>
<note target="#b752" type="interp" resp="#LZM">752] <ex rend="angle">e</ex> hescïant: Turin reads <hi rend="italic">a bona fede e yntenzione</hi>, "with good faith and intention"; other appearances of a <hi rend="italic">(h)esiant/ (h)esient</hi> here are a preposition with a noun, "knowingly, with good intention."</note>
<note target="#b759" type="edit" resp="#LZM">759] MS: alot; probably missing the abbreviation for "n"; cf. lines 1013, 7909, for forms of "aler" plus the present participle; so here would read alo<ex rend="angle">n</ex> t devisant, 'as they were setting up'.</note>
<note target="#b790" type="interp" resp="#LZM"> 790] MS: empial. Cf. vv. 47, 73, 373, etc., where we see <hi rend="italic">emp[er]ial</hi>. However, see <hi rend="italic">empir</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Prise de Pampelune</hi> (v. 4970) and the many other variants. As one of the most frequent words in epic vocabulary, it is greatly varied in rhyme. Furthermore, in Italian, "empio" means "irreligioso, sacrilego, profanatore" and "spietato, crudele" (Zingarelli) so while there is the hint of emperor, there is also the sense of merciless, sacrilegious ruler.</note>
 <note target="#b802" type="interp" resp="#LZM">802] <hi rend="italic">seinté</hi>: this seems to be a combination of "seinté" and "è," 'holiness is'.</note>
 <note target="#b810" type="edit" resp="#LZM">810] <hi rend="italic">m'en</hi>: the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is very evidently effaced, while all the other letters around it are clear.</note>
<note target="#b818" type="lex" resp="#LZM">818] MS: abosdivoir. Cf. <hi rend="italic">Entrée d'Espagne: bosdeor</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Guerra d'Attila: bosder, bosdeor, bosdera, bosdie</hi>, etc.</note>
<note target="#b888" type="codic" resp="#LZM">888] MS: confortas ɾoe</note>
<note target="#b923" type="lex" resp="#LZM">923] <hi rend="italic">Tutore</hi>: cf. www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/tuttora_(Enciclopedia-Dantesca)/. Typical of Old Italian, found in Dante, the <hi rend="italic">Fiore</hi>, etc. Consulted Nov. 26, 2016.</note>
   <note target="#b941" type="lex" resp="#LZM">941] <hi rend="italic">baor</hi>: cf. T-L "baudor" (col. 887), with lenition of the intervocalic occlusive.</note>
<note target="#b948" type="codic" resp="#LZM">948] MS: monreç</note>
   <note target="#b952" type="lex" resp="#LZM">9452 <hi rend="italic">hor</hi> cf. T-L "or, ëur," cols. 1163-64; Matsumura "or<hi rend="super">2</hi>, eur"</note>
   <note target="#b954" type="edit" resp="#LZM">954] MS: il che. Alternate reading: <hi rend="italic">ch'e il diable traïtor. / Le ont...</hi> (that he is the traitor devil. / They chased him out...).</note>
<note target="#b960" type="ling" resp="#LZM">960] Note the Italianate construction of definite article + possessive.</note>
<note target="#b977" type="interp" resp="#LZM">977] <hi rend="italic">haïr</hi>: this could be <hi rend="italic">haïr</hi>, anger, but we are interpreting it as "air" to go with the Turin reading and also the sense here: out the window and into the air, the sky.</note>
   <note target="#b1041" type="lex" resp="#LZM">1041] 1041] <hi rend="italic">Ni anch portant</hi>: anch inserted in "neportant" (T-L col. 593; cf. Matsumura "néanmoins"). </note>
<note target="#b1062" type="trans" resp="#LZM">1062] This laisse is included in Tobler, p. 615. He does not always resolve abbreviations as here, always using "n" for the titulus indicating a nasal. There are no substantial differences in transcription.</note>
<note target="#b1092" type="ref" resp="#LZM">1092] Caton: here refers to the <hi rend="italic">Distichs of Cato, Disticha catonis</hi>:  Quote from <hi rend="italic">Catonis distichorum</hi>, Book 1, 8:  Nil temere uxori de servis crede querenti; Saepe enim mulier, quem coniux diligit, odit [Believe nothing blindly of a wife complaining about the servants; For often a wife hates the one the husband likes]. Text and translation provided by Jim Marchand at http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/distich.trans.html.</note>
 <note target="#b1149" type="edit" resp="#LZM">1149] <hi rend="italic">la</hi> is almost unreadable in the manuscript. It is unclear whether this was intentional or not on the part of the scribe or was done later; it seems to be something painted over those letters, but similar to a spot on the left side of the page of a chocolate or cafeaulait color.</note>
<note target="#b1152" type="codic" resp="#LZM">1152] Catchword at the bottom of the page, almost entirely washed out:<hi rend="italic">si</hi></note>
<note target="#b1159" type="ling" resp="#LZM">1159] There are three other forms (<hi rend="italic">aflicions</hi> twice, <hi rend="italic">aflicion</hi> once), all in rhyme position. Therefore I here presume <hi rend="italic">aflicion</hi> as the base form, here elided with the preposition <hi rend="italic">a</hi>.</note>
<note target="#b1174" type="biblio" resp="#LZM">  1174] Vulgate Psalm 118, l. 133: "Gressus meos dirige." All translations of the Bible are taken from <hi rend="italic">The New Oxford Annotated Bible with Apocrypha</hi>  (Expanded version), Revised Standard Version (NY: Oxford UP, 1977).  There it is Psalm 119, p. 753, with translation given in this translation.</note>
<note target="#b1180" type="trans" resp="#LZM">1180] Transcribed by Tobler, lines 1180-1220 (pp. 615-16). We note any substantial differences here. As noted above, his resolution of abbreviations differs; thus, "Par moy" for line 1218, etc.</note>
<note target="#b1250" type="codic" resp="#LZM">1250] Between lines 1249 and 1250 in column 9Va, running into the right margin is a line with an "x"; also at the bottom of column 9va, there is a line with a corresponding "x" in the left margin. Since the column is one line too long in comparison to the other, and normally the columns are equal, this final line (1264) is clearly to be moved to the position between 1249 and 1250.</note>
<note target="#b1295" type="trans" resp="#LZM">1295] This laisse is also transcribed by Tobler (pp. 616-17); again we note any substantial differences of transcription.</note>
<note target="#b1300" type="inter" resp="#LZM">1300] This line is problematic; we are interpreting as a separated future (<hi rend="italic">ti ho dire = ti dirò</hi>). T has difficulties with it as well, with a substantial difference in reading: line 1287 <hi rend="italic">Se zò mantene che</hi> tu ai dito i[n] to s[er]mone, ("If you continue that which you have said in your speech"); cf. <hi rend="italic">diroy</hi> (vv. 1246, 1944, 2422, 2448), in rhyme position.</note>
<note target="#b1329" type="trans" resp="#LZM">1329] Tobler: uoire / non poit. MS: voie</note>
<note target="#b1356" type="codic" resp="#LZM">1356] MS: tot. This section is difficult to read; the initial of the following line seems to have been changed from a "T" to a "C."</note>   
<note target="#b1361" type="interp" resp="#JVC">1361] <hi rend="italic">"Sir</hi> désigne la ville de Tyr, puisque les tissus d'Orient étaient réputés et <ex rend="brackets">...</ex> l'on indique volentiers une ville d'Orient comme lieu d'où provient un tissu précieux" ("Sir" refers to the city Tyre, since oriental fabrics were famous and a famous city of the East is frequently used as a source for a valuable fabric (Vallecalle, trans. LZM)).</note>
<note target="#b1390" type="interp" resp="#JVC">1390] The Latin "Magnificat" text runs, "Magnificat anima mea Dominum," "My soul magnifies the Lord" (Luke 1.46). Here the scribe (or redactor/author) says, "Magnify <ex rend="brackets">my</ex> soul, O Lord."</note>  
<note target="#b1399" type="interp" resp="#LZM">1399] MS: ma[n]da na, however it seems most likely to be an error for "via[n]da na"; cf. line 6181 <hi rend="italic">viande n'a</hi></note>
<note target="#b1523" type="codic" resp="#LZM">1523] <hi rend="italic">Celor</hi>: the initial is an unusual shape, between a "C" and an "L."</note>
<note target="#b1541" type="codic" resp="#LZM">1541] MS: q eloiaute; an <hi rend="italic">n</hi>seems to be elided, which would have read: <hi rend="italic">Q'en loiauté</hi></note>
<note target="#b1559" type="inter" resp="#LZM">1559] <hi rend="italic">chareme</hi>: interpreted as "carême," fasting.</note>
<note target="#b1667" type="ling" resp="#LZM">1667]  In the rhyme position, the verb "savoir" takes this unusual form.</note>
<note target="#b1698" type="lex" resp="#LZM">1698]  MS: riponse; cf. forms of <hi rend="italic"> reponser </hi>(v. 2505, 2690, etc.). Meregazzi, "L'<hi rend="italic">Ugo d'Alvernia</hi>," notes a possible analogue to this episode in <hi rend="italic">Renaut de Montauban</hi>, where a local citizen informs the knight that the city is besieged by Saracens (pp. 18-19). That similarity is continued in that both refuse to rule the kingdom and each is sent further on, Huon to the Holy Sepulcher and Renaut to Brindisi.</note>
<note target="#b1707" type="codic" resp="#LZM">1707] MS: constatinople</note>
<note target="#b1711" type="codic" resp="#LZM">1711] MS: afie đs (crossed 'd' and long 's' above the line between 'a' and 'f')</note>
<note target="#b1726" type="interp" resp="#LZM">1726] gl<hi rend="italic">ori</hi>e: this is the most frequent form in the text when the word is written out; even with the resolution "gl<hi rend="italic">oir</hi>e" the syllable count is high.</note>
<note target="#b1748" type="interp" resp="#LZM">1748] <hi rend="italic">trainé</hi> here is the infinitive, missing the final <hi rend="italic"> -r</hi> ; that is how T understood the line. Alternatively it could be <hi rend="italic">v'oit trainé</hi>, "the kings had there dragged before them."</note>
 <note target="#b1749" type="codic" resp="#LZM">1749] The MS is damaged at this point and extremely difficult to read, but the digital copy clarifies the reading; the tradition was problematic, since T's reading is quite different: <hi rend="italic">morty zasere al sabione</hi> <ex rend="brackets">dead men lying on the sand</ex>. If the reading here were similar, it might be <hi rend="italic">hon veit sor ce gravois</hi>; but the two are not always parallel. <hi rend="italic">Gravoy</hi> appears appears five times, <hi rend="italic">gravois</hi> once, meaning "sand" or "gravel" in some way (path, etc.) in this MS. The two emendations made here both address common errors: a missing stroke and an incorrect connector between strokes.</note>
<note target="#b1753" type="codic" resp="#LZM">1753] The beginning of this column is faded in parts, though the outlines of strokes are clear. For multiple minims, there can always be doubts, but in searching other F-I texts there are no forms of <hi rend="italic">sui-</hi> for the verb "to follow," whereas there are 68 forms of <hi rend="italic">siv- </hi> attested in FIOLA. RIALFrI however, offers both. In this text there are 3 other forms with <hi rend="italic">siv-</hi>, one <hi rend="italic">seut</hi>, but none with <hi rend="italic"> sui-</hi>.</note>
<note target="#b1798" type="lex" resp="#LZM">1798] <hi rend="italic">guioner</hi>: cf. Holtus (<hi rend="italic">Lexikalische</hi>, p. 346), "guide"</note>

 <note target="#b1855" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> 1855] Note that this column is one line shorter than the following, and there is a flag rising from the illumination below into the column. This poses interesting questions as to the order in which the work was done.</note>  
<note target="#b1881" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> 1881] MS: nos</note>
<note target="#b1910" type="lex" resp="#LZM">1910] <hi rend="italic">enci:</hi> cf. Holtus (<hi rend="italic"> Lexikalische</hi> p. 290), "ici," 'here'</note>
<note target="#b1914" type="codic" resp="#LZM">1914] MS: et. The word <hi rend="italic">et</hi> seems out of place here; we emend to <hi rend="italic">e</hi><ex rend="angle">'</ex> (for "I"). Cf. T line 1911, <hi rend="italic">Homo sonto de Carlo Martelo. </hi></note>
 <note target="#b1975" type="interp" resp="#LZM">  1975] Note the theme of a vow while on a quest; his ancestor, Guillaume d'Orange, vowed not to change his clothes, wash his hair, eat meat or stew; he won't drink wine or liquor, kiss anyone, or sleep in a bed, until he returned home with Guibourc; he too drinks only water and eats only rough bread (<hi rend="italic">Aliscans</hi>; for an English translation, see Ferrante). Guillaume will be Huon's guide in Hell, as we will see.</note>
<note target="#b2022" type="interp" resp="#LZM">  2022] Turin differs substantially here: <hi rend= "italic">se luy lassa ora, el</hi> parerà a questo ponto "if he leaves now, it will be evident at this point" (T 2015).</note>
<note target="#b2111" type="interp" resp="#LZM">2111] This line is missing from Turin. It is problematic; "sovent" elsewhere here is the adverb; however "sovenir" appears and other forms of the verb.</note>
 <note target="#b2115" type="codic" resp="#LZM">2115] Between <hi rend="italic"> les</hi> and <hi rend="italic">afi</hi> at the end of the line is a hole in the MS; afi seems to be written deliberately after it; there does not seem to be any letter missing. J.-C. Vallecalle suggests that it might have been an <hi rend="italic">a</hi> there <ex rend="brackets">possibly scraped off?</ex>, making the line read <hi rend="italic">Posible çonse il fust, bien le sai a fi,</hi> that is, "This [Huon's mission in Hell] would be possible, I know certainly (... if Hell were built on earth)."</note>
<note target="#b2130" type="interp" resp="#LZM">2130] <hi rend="italic">gieter </hi> may have been the original reading of the text, for "how to shoot a bow"; or this may be a form of "guerrer" to fight, since many Franco-Italian texts have forms of "gere" and "gerer" for MF 'guerre' and 'guerrier'.</note>

<note target="#b3852" type="interp" resp="#LZM">3852] This is a very Italian episode; the city-states in the Peninsula regularly exiled members of a losing party, who then ran coups from neighboring cities.

The constant wars of the fourteenth century in the northern Italian Peninsula reflected the various parties representing different interests changing allies and strength.</note>

It is clear that there is a problem in sense; there are supposedly five messengers, of whom two are mentioned in Turin (vv. 5652-53), these first two here; they are sent to Ynide and she rejects them in two laisses that are not present here. The ambassadors complete an initial embassy that is refused, and then at line T 4706, the equivalent of B 4704 picks up. Among those mentioned with the ambassadors, at various points, are 15 names: Ruçer/Rugier; Teris; Henri/Enri d'Aubespine; Belençer (marchis); Morant d'Autefoie (relative of Rugier and the Archbishop); Gui de Barcelune; Conte Gallerant d'Arthois; duc Tholomeu/Tholomeis; Uger de la Savine; Gauter de Clervant (queens); the Archbishop of Mainz (Maance); Saudin; Aumeri; Galerains de Bertagne; and Riçars, le sir de Normandie.</note>

With ultraviolet, one can almost see "q" and "e", and maybe something above the line too, "qe" with "u" above the line? Or just a bit of chalk solution or whatever they used.

There are two possible avenues for distraction, the first written, and the second oral. In the first column of this folio, in line four (this is line 3 of column two) in line 4707, "Tholomeu" appears, so could have distracted a copyist.

Dante <hi rend="italic">Par</hi>. 1, 70. This would be one of its earliest usages after Dante (DELI: before 1321, Dante, first use) if that is what it is. But as PEB points out, "de suor" is 'with sweat' (cf. vv. 2504, 5027, 6821) so the preceding word is probably a rendering for "tressüer," 'to sweat in big drops'. The "suelee" then remains to solve; there is no similar other expression in the MS. There are forms of "svelleir," 'to be awake, to awaken', and that seems most likely here. In RIALFrI, "suel" forms are primarily from the verb 'to be accustomed to,' not an adjective 'alone.'.</note>

There are also a few minor figures: Grailet, Melians e Gralant. The name Morant appears on both sides: among Huon's men and with the ambassadors. There are also multiple appearances of "Teris" and "Thomas" in various forms.</note>
 <note target="#b5443" type="interp" resp="#LZM">5443] One wonders about the significance of the holy figure here.

    <note target="#b5445" type="codic" resp="#LZM">5445] Saint Helen was the mother of Constantine, who went to Jerusalem and the toured the Holy Land, supposedly discovering the True Cross. She also founded and beautified various churches. She brought various relics back to Rome, and down the street from St. John in Lateran is her Basilica of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, where her head graces a classical statue, near the Aurelian walls. The floor was originally with dirt brought back from the Holy Land; thus perhaps the appropriateness of such a site here for Ynide's prayer and its particular appeal to Christ.</note>

This would be the only time in the text the form would appear after the noun. It could also be <hi rend="italic">s'oie</hi>: "he also had [held] the entire time." The three lines 7701-7703 refer to the episode in the illumination at the bottom of the page, where burning masses fall into water, and spirits are led along the side of the stream; the language seems to be corrupted. Compare T 7383: Vite un monte che tuto se corla e tuto <hi rend="italic">brusa</hi>, for B 7702; there is no equivalent to 7701. Perhaps it means "He called on God, Holding the cross in his hand the whole time." In line 7702, the word "sevre" or "seure" could be related to "(es)sever," 'drain, channel, ditch' from 'to stream out, flow away' (similar to Modern English "sewer"). Cf. Matsumura, "essee":  "canal d'écoulement." Stengel ("Huons Suche," p. 21): Si l'avoit seüré [...] qui crolle. In fact there would seem to be a confusion of what is illustrated here: burning masses appear from v. 7365 to 7398 (v. 51V, where the illumination instead is of the divided humans, vv. 7349-62), whence the griffons ultimately lift Huon and his horse to the other side.</note>

<note target="#b9468" type="refer" resp="#LZM">9468] Cf. Dante, <hi rend="italic">Inf.</hi> 2.13; according to tradition, Aeneas had a son after his death, whom his wife bore in the woods, so named him "Silvius." Various Latin historians give "Aeneas Silvius" as the son of Silvius (Livy, <hi rend="italic">Ab urbe conditor</hi> 1.3; Dionysius of Helicarnassus, <hi rend="italic">Antiquitates romanae</hi> 1.71, Perseus); according to the same historians, his successor was Latinus Silvius. In any case, the descendants of the rulers of the Trojan settlement took the cognomen "Silvius" attached to personal names. Here then the "Silvian" seems to refer to the family line initiated by Aeneas's father, Anchises, whom Aeneas brought with him away from Troy. The father did not make it to the Italian peninsula. Scattolini notes that the reference is backwords and turned around though refering to <hi rend="italic">Inf.</hi> (361 n641).</note>

For <hi rend="italic">robist</hi> (T-L rubist, col. 1529), see also Holtus (<hi rend="italic">Lexikalische</hi>, p. 431) who suggests a derivation from Italian RUPES, producing a landscape element, as he also says not always clearly identifiable from the context, and Mainone (<hi rend="italic">Laut und Form</hi>, p. 30). 
       However, "robestre" the adjective also appears in F-I for "wild"; see the same page for Holtus. 
       For <hi rend="italic">fagon</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Attila</hi> gives "facion: .... fazione, l'insieme di schiere di soldati." 
       Mainone is unclear as to the meaning; he originally suggests <hi rend="italic">robist</hi> as deriving from a verb form, but being the adjective "wild" [Fr. "rubeste," Ital "rubesto"], each of the sinners in the mud ( he suggests "fagon" is like "fango," "mud," in  <hi rend="italic">Huon</hi> T and P). Tobler-Lommatsch defines "fouc" as 'Schar' [crowd, host], but here Holtus also designates <hi rend="italic">robist</hi> as an adjective, and similarly Di Ninni in Niccolò da Verona's <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi>. Tobler-Lommatsch defines "fouc" as 'Schar' [crowd, host], but here there is no element relating the word to the preceding one, so it would seem to be an adjective. For the grammar, the section would then seem to mean something like, "those of the violent crowd/troop."

<note target="#b9716.1" type="codic" resp="#LZM">9716.1] The illumination at the bottom of this page is of a city with five towers visible, a figure in red (with head covering) at the top of the first gate on the left, nearest the three visitors who are at the far left. The gate figure holds a book with black dots to represent writing on it. Note that the tower is square, suggesting that "reont" refers to something else. <hi rend="italic">Charere</hi> (line 9915) means both "chair" (<hi rend="italic">cattedra</hi> in MSI) and "highway" in this text, as confirmed by other Franco-Italian texts. In fact, the gateway is rounded and the human figure is at the highest point. Since this is a scholar with a book, it makes the most sense for him to be in a chair or seat. The portion remaining in the Turin MS (folio 146R) shows a loggia with rounded openings to the left of the illumination, with the three travellers outside to the left. One figure inside (with a fancy headdress) is on a chair with a baldacchino in a polygonal shape (not quite a circle, but circular) above. Since the walls in the Berlin MS illumination reach outside the frame, there is nothing above the figure who is on top of the gate there.

<note target="#b10329" type="interp" resp="#AEB">10329] <hi rend="italic">Tisiaus</hi>: Tisias is reported to have been the first theoretician of rhetoric in ancient Greece. It is taken that he was the student of one Corax, who has left no written work. Tradition has it that, after the fall of the monarchy in Sicily in the 5th c. BCE, the rise of democracy occasioned a need for persuasive speech (command no longer being accepted). One successful Sicilian practitioner was Gorgias who went to Athens in 427 BCE, where he became a major figure among the Sophists. In the <title rend="italic">Gorgias</title>, Plato accused rhetoricians of favoring opinion over truth, success in the moment over enduring verities. (See also <title rend="italic">Phaedrus</title> 267a-b.) Thus, in the history of rhetoric, Tisias would stand in the same relationship to rhetoric as the Sophists to sophistry. Support for this view comes in the theory that Corax was not a separate person, but that the word, which means "crow" is actually a derogatory nickname for Tisias himself. Rhetoric received a higher standing with Aristotle, fascinated with how things break down into their component parts, who wrote his <title rend="italic">Rhetoric</title> as an analytical guide to, and practical manual for, the art—but he distinguished it from logic (dialectic). In the later Middle Ages, therefore, Tisias may be taken as a mythical founder, an archetype for all who indulge in untruth for emotional effect. Whatever his reputation in antiquity, in this passage, Berlin, lines 10324-10351, Tisias seems to represent all seven liberal arts (10328). The reference to his singing includes another of the seven: grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.

<note target="#b10335.1" type="interp" resp="#LZM">10335.1] This scene may refer to the beginning of the mass; at that era, the "introit involves the singing of a Psalm, which by this period would have been sung alternatingly by two choir bodies." It may be like improvisory practice where "one singer or group of singers would sing the original chant tune, and the other voices might improvise or sing composed counterpoint above it" and "vocal polyphony was used during mass, often with a low line carrying the chant tune, and upper voices providing countermelodies, improvised or otherwise." Where and when it was done and if the celebrant was involved would be difficult to verify since the specific origin of this story is not known. We thank Remi Chiu (Fine Arts (Music), LUM) his collaboration.

Turin  10248 instead understands as "I will never do such an order (command)," "No[n] farazo my," dize lo [con]te, "tal comandame[n]to", and the "my" [MSI 'mica'] is perhaps what led Mainone astray.</note>

The closest possibility in OF dictionaries seems to be "amoistir," to dampen, thus our word division. Looking elsewhere in the text we find "moit" (v. 7121) from "to move"; Matsumura lists "amovoir" but not reflexive form; T-L lists a possibly reflexive "movoir." If this were the case, it would signify "to gesticulate" as the text suggests already when he begs for pardon (v. 10730). The following tears and frequent expressions elsewhere about his dampening himself with tears make that seem more attractive as a possibility. An equivalent line is missing from Turin. RIALFrI includes two forms, "amoistir" (refering to preparing of meat to cook, Brunetto Latini) and "amoistist" (speaking of milk moistening the body; Aldobrandino da Siena).

However, with fewer emendations, the line  could just be missing an abbreviation for a final consonant: <ex rend="brackets">cher</ex> : "It is not Hell that I hold dear, lord." Stengel seems to have the right idea for the second hemistich (there are three forms of "che[r]re" in our text for "to seek") but removing an "n" as in the first hemistich is unusual.  We are looking at Turin here to help us; the "n" is thus a partitive pronoun (MF <hi rend="italic">en</hi>). Cf.

<note target="#b12198" type="interp" resp="#LZM">12198] It is unclear whom the poet might have in mind for reconquering the Empire from the Germans in 100 years (Turin gives  400 years). Giovanni Villani's <hi rend="italic">Nuova Cronica</hi> (ed. by Giuseppe Porta [Parma: Fondazione Pietro Bembo / Ugo Guanda, 1991]; e-text downloaded 10 June 2018,   https://www.liberliber.it/mediateca/libri/v/villani/nuova_cronica/pdf/nuova__p.pdf) which dates to the beginning of the fourteenth century, mentions various rulers named "Carlo Martello," and it is a recurring name in the Anjou family. The <hi rend="italic">Cronica</hi> notes that Charlemagne's family ceased ruling at the time of Ugo Ciapetta, Duca d'Orliensa. It tells of a Carlo Martello in the 1280's (pp. 200 ff), who, by his actions in the southern portion of the Italian peninsula and Sicily, seems to refer to the Charles Martel who lived 1271-95. The Anjou family in the peninsula in any case was very important, so either this reference or that of Turin may be linked to the French royal family in the peninsula at the time of the poem.</note>
