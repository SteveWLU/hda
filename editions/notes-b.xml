<note target="#b1" type="trans" resp="#LZM">1] Holtus ("Considerazioni") published lines 1-109; his edition is a diplomatic one (45-48), with abbreviations reproduced and word divisions as in the manuscript. Tobler ("Berliner") published lines 1-111 (pp. 617-19); he reproduces the text without punctuation other than the final periods and the lines that mark caesura here at the beginning of the poem, and without distinguishing u/v.</note>
<note target="#b12" type="codic" resp="#LZM">12] MS: une (final -e is expunctuated)</note>
<note target="#b21" type="edit" resp="#LZM">21] The initial here is very faded; the external background is gold, the internal illustration is red with a figure inside, so the original would seem to be blue, though it is currently faded and purplish.</note>
   <note target="#b55" type="codic" resp="#LZM">55] MS: quilens or quueus with "il" or second 'u' expunctuated (the second stroke is a bit longer than the first); the line is one syllable too long, with the hemistich divider after <hi rend="italic">ferté</hi>; if instead it were after plus, the conjunction could elide with the final vowel of <hi rend="italic">ferté</hi> according to Italian sinalepha rules.</note>
<note target="#b76" type="trans" resp="#LZM">76] Tobler omits the superscript after ".iiii."; Holtus seems to have a small "m" over the roman numeral. This MS abbreviation appears only with ".iiii." (six times) and would seem to be validated by line 6271, when in a prayer Christ arose after 4 days; and in line 11057, where four men are chosen as electors for the king to replace Charles Martel, and listed immediately thereafter. Furthermore, the "m" in lines 9334 and 11496 has no final upstroke.</note>
 <note target="#b86" type="interp" resp="#LZM">86] <hi rend="italic">ster</hi>: seems to here be a conjugated verb. Cf forms <hi rend="italic">stent</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ster</hi> (these last as infinitives) in the poem.</note>
 <note target="#b97" type="lex" resp="#LZM">97] <hi rend="italic">sorage</hi>: 'brother-in-law' (T-L serorge)</note>
   <note target="#b106" type="edit" resp="#LZM">106] MS: Une hostel; T 106 reads <hi rend="italic">una chasa che Ynida l</hi>a vite de longo [that Ynide saw from afar], a similar original might be the reason for the agreement error.</note>
<note target="#b109" type="trans" resp="#LZM">109] End of Holtus's diplomatic transcription ("Considerazioni").</note>
<note target="#b111" type="trans" resp="#LZM">111] End of Tobler's edited selection ("Berliner").</note>
<note target="#b136" type="edit" resp="#LZM">136] All text that is written above the line in the original is enclosed in parentheses in this transcription.</note>
<note target="#b139" type="edit" resp="#LZM">139] MS is missing a word for "horse"; since the phrase is a fixed formula (see lines 1182, 7290, 7297), here we insert "civals" to accord with two of the other three uses of "crenu" and its forms. "Destrer" would be another possibility.</note>
   <note target="#b167" type="interp" resp="#LZM">167]There seems to be a problem with this line. In B "lou" normally means either 'place' (MSF lieu) or 'the' (MSF le).  Here, however, a verb seems to be missing; perhaps, similarly T 168: luy et Ugon, this should be "lu o," 'he with'. For modern readers, the sentence has been reordered: <hi rend="italic">qui</hi> = there; <hi rend="italic">ou</hi> = with; <hi rend="italic">lou</hi> = when (col. 14); literally, it would be "There with Bernard, the son of John the warrior, Held court when Huon the knight...".</note>
<note target="#b168" type="interp" resp="#LZM">168]<hi rend="italic">timbre</hi>: this is a psaltery, not what one normally expects for a call to fight, is the first definition (Matsumura). However, one also finds 'drum' and 'tamburine' (T-L, col. 307). Perhaps there is a metathesis of the "r" for  "t[r]ombe"; T 169: <hi rend="italic">el feze i lifante e le c</hi>inbale sonare </note>
   <note target="#b185" type="edit" resp="#LZM">185] <hi rend="italic">chacer</hi>: the first 'c' has a red x within the loop.</note>  
<note target="#b200" type="interp" resp="#LZM">200] This line is problematic for sense; the Turin version is also unclear.</note>
 <note target="#b231" type="interp" resp="#LZM">231] <hi rend="italic">pis</hi>: the reading is clear in the MS; yet see T 230: <hi rend="italic">fora solamente qu</hi>ando el vole dal re lo presio [except when he saw the valor of the king].</note>
   <note target="#b234" type="interp" resp="#LZM">234] T 233 does not include this wording:  <hi rend="italic">anzé se fereno</hi> de coro e de fede [they hit each other spiritedly and in good faith]; <hi rend="italic">pis</hi>: T-L piz, "Brust des Menschen" [human chest]).</note> 
   <note target="#b245" type="codic" resp="#LZM">245] <hi rend="italic">reuser</hi>: reculer (Matsumura). Cf. GdA, 'rovesciare, respingere' [to knock over, push back]</note>
   <note target="#b262" type="interp" resp="#LZM">262] Laisse 10: the metrics of this laisse seem to required that the final -<hi rend="italic">re</hi> be counted as an atonic syllable as in Italian, or a unstressed -<hi rend="italic">e</hi> in a "lyric" caesura, which makes almost all lines regular. We have therefore counted it consistently so. This is like unstressed feminine -<hi rend="italic">e</hi> endings elsewhere in the poem, as in the following laisse. See Introduction, part D, Versification.</note>
   <note target="#b302" type="lex" resp="#LZM">302] de Costance: this is consistently the form of a proper noun in Franco-Italian, referring to either a person or a place; of 13 appearances in this spelling in RIALFrI, 4 are a place ("de Costance") and 4 are a woman's name (the other five are all from Brunetto Latini's <hi rend="italic">Trésor</hi>, a moralizing work); all four of the forms "Costançe" are a place name ("de Costançe") (consulted 7 December 2021). All are objects or people from a place (l'elme de...; cité de ...; neç de...; l'or de...; paile de...; Ervi de...). Repertoires of place names in chansons de geste suggest either Coutances (Manche, Normandy) or the German town of Konstanz (in Baden Württemberg, southern Germany). There is also a Constanţa in eastern Romania, worth mentioning here given the extent of Huon's travels and Scythia's fame for horses. There are only two uses here and they are in rhyme for the origin of a horse both times; cf. 8606 below.</note>  
<note target="#b320" type="interp" resp="#LZM">320] <hi rend="italic">engoler</hi>: Cf. Holtus <hi rend="italic">Aliscans</hi> v. 7560.</note>
   <note target="#b321" type="lex" resp="#LZM">321] <hi rend="italic">tornoier</hi>: cf. Gambino, "Code-mixing nel <hi rend="italic">Bovo d'Antona</hi>," p. 79, tornier.</note> 
   <note target="#b339" type="interp" resp="#LZM">339] engajer: engage, as security, in case of misbehavior; cf. <hi rend="italic"> Guiron</hi>, https://www.rialfri.eu/rialfriPHP/public/testo/testo/ordinata/ot|rialfri|guironMarciano|001|12229/query/l#mark, 15 August 2022; <hi rend="italic">EE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">engajés, engajees</hi>, also RIALFrI, 15 August 2022. </note>
   <note target="#b343" type="edit" resp="#LZM">343] MS: nolōns. Cf. T 340  <hi rend="italic">che da nesun hom</hi>o no[n] abiamo nula y[m]pazo [so that we have no hindrance from anyone (lit., any man)]. The use of -<hi rend="italic">on(s)</hi> for first person plural is typical in F-I; cf. <hi rend="italic">AdB</hi>, vol. 3, pp. 154-55, thus <hi rend="italic">ons</hi> for <hi rend="italic">avoir</hi>.  Cf. Rohlfs ¶ 541 for northeastern Italy.</note>
   <note target="#b393" type="lex" resp="#LZM">393] <hi rend="italic">enmue</hi>: sight rhyme; T-L enmüir (= amüir), 'verstummen' [to become silent, fall silent]</note>
 <note target="#b402" type="lex" resp="#LZM">402] <hi rend="italic">vancel</hi>: see T-L vanerie; cf. Petit Robert <hi rend="italic">vanne</hi> (dated 1274).</note>
 <note target="#b405" type="interp" resp="#LZM">405] For the forms <hi rend="italic">glese, glesse, glesie</hi>, see Holtus (<hi rend="italic">Lexikalische</hi>, p. 341).</note>
<note target="#b415" type="edit" resp="#LZM">415] MS: ia belist. <hi rend="italic">belist</hi> is a hapax. Elsewhere in the text, we find <hi rend="italic">abellir; abelist; abelli</hi>, e.g., 4168, 6320, etc.</note>
   <note target="#b419" type="interp" resp="#LZM">419] Cf. T 416 <hi rend="italic">saludò ley dizendo: "Quel magno Redentore</hi> [he greeted her saying, "That great Redeemer..."]</note>
   <note target="#b439" type="codic" resp="#LZM">439-440] These two lines have a special handle at the start, a sort of manicule, in red before 439, in blue before 440 (see Clemens and Graham, <hi rend="italic">Manuscript Studies</hi>, p. 44-45). There is a note in the left margin before them, between the two, that reads .not. with a line above that has a little hump in it just past the middle (folio 4R, to the left, 10-11 lines from the bottom of the written column): "notat", commenting on the proverbial expression (Capelli, <hi rend="italic">Dizionario</hi>, p. 240, for "not" with an abbreviation line). </note>
 <note target="#b498" type="lex" resp="#LZM">498] <hi rend="italic">gamentoit</hi>: Cf. <hi rend="italic">EE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">gaumenter</hi> (T-L gaimenter), but also 9746 here, "gamenta de soit" [he complained of thirst]. It is possible that this is a combination of "gemere" (to weep, lament) that DELI dates before Dante, before 1321, plus "lamentare," or possibly with a frequentative created on "gemito," the past participle of "gemere."</note>
<note target="#b508" type="edit" resp="#LZM">508]There is a "+" in the right margin in light brown ink, perhaps inserted by a nineteenth-century reader? See also note to v. 545.</note>
<note target="#b533" type="interp" resp="#LZM">533] MS: hastivement: there seems to be a problem with the tradition at this point; T reads (according to Rajna) "<hi rend="italic">studevelmente</hi>."</note>
<note target="#b542" type="codic" resp="#LZM">542] MS: gamēt, with a side-ways "u" over "g" toward the "m"</note>
     <note target="#b545" type="codic" resp="#LZM">542] There is an "X" to the left of the beginning of this line. It is not clear whether that refers to this line, or to the line in the previous column, v. 508.</note>    
   <note target="#b549" type="lex" resp="#LZM"> 549] <hi rend="italic">atent</hi>: this has been one of the most discussed lexical items between French and Italian speakers. In Italian "attenere" (DELI, intransitive, beg. 14th century) is defined as 'spettare, concernere', and is clearly the meaning here: 'belong to you, concern you'</note>
     <note target="#b565" type="codic" resp="#LZM">565] <hi rend="italic">de lor</hi> (MS le lor): While <hi rend="italic">le lor </hi>does appear in the MS, it is generally as a possessive pronoun or adjective, and never appears elsewhere after <hi rend="italic">afor/afors</hi> or related preposition/adverb. Cf. T560: <hi rend="italic">e possa guardò avante, luy no[n] li vite afora lor</hi> [and then he looked forward, he didn't seen anyone there except them]. While T is not always the best guide, nor always exactly consonant with B, it offers a good possibility in this line. It also works with the versification.</note>
     <note target="#b610" type="interp" resp="#LZM">610] Alternate reading: si l'afier spiera, "if they suspect the affair/event"; cf. T 605: se l'afar spiarà [if he hears of the affair/event].</note>
     <note target="#b616" type="interp" resp="#LZM">616] <ex rend="angle">a</ex> Deu plest: cf. T 611 se a Dio piaze bon [con]seio se trovarà [if it pleases God, good advice will be found]. The line is short one syllable, so the emendation is logical.</note>
     <note target="#b660" type="lex" resp="#LZM">660] <hi rend="italic">loër</hi>: T-L col 566,  gewähren [grant, accord]</note>
<note target="#b669" type="edit" resp="#LZM">669] MS missing the abbreviation mark here in <hi rend="italic">acoplir</hi>; cf. Vv. 1271, 1282, etc.</note>
<note target="#b674" type="edit" resp="#LZM">674] The MS is difficult to read: 'r' of <hi rend="italic">complira</hi> is unclear. It would seem that there is something above the line, but the section is faded. T 669: <hi rend="italic">acompirà</hi> [will fulfill].</note>
   <note target="#b701" type="lex" resp="#LZM">701] <hi rend="italic">le jugor</hi>: T 696 <hi rend="italic">vuy dovite e</hi>sere signore lo mazore [and you should be the greatest lord]. The B line seems an odd form; <hi rend="italic">vigor </hi> would not make sense in this section, though at first glance that seems to be the reading. Elsewhere vigor clearly paired with <hi rend="italic">force</hi> in a synonymic pair (vv. 936, 1838, 11743, 11929) or used after a preposition to indicate strength (vv. 6897, 9094).</note>
     <note target="#b704" type="interp" resp="#LZM">704] These lines are difficult to understand. In T 699, the verb is in the second plural, and "vuy" is the subject: <hi rend="italic">a drito dovite e</hi>sere vuy de lor suo pastore [by right you should be their pastor/lord]. Perhaps it can be best understood as an aside to the councillors present. See the note in the translation. </note>
<note target="#b715" type="interp" resp="#LZM">715] <ex rend="angle">la</ex> added for sense and syllable count; cf. T: 709 <ex rend="italic">lizeramente la</ex> porite vuy possa avere.</note>  
     <note target="#b751" type="codic" resp="#LZM">751] p<hi rend="italic">re</hi>gant: the "g" has an unusual form; it looks more like a "y." The syllable count is 7+6; T 745 devotamente pregando Dio ch'e<hi rend="italic">l guarde da torme[n]to</hi> [devotedly praying [to] God that He guard him from torment], one might omit <hi rend="italic">mal</hi> (torment being bad by definition) to reduce to 7+5.</note>
   <note target="#b752" type="interp" resp="#LZM">752] <ex rend="angle">e</ex> hescïant: Turin reads <hi rend="italic">a bona fede e yntenzione</hi>, "with good faith and intention"; other appearances of a <hi rend="italic">(h)esiant/ (h)esient</hi> here are a preposition with a noun, "knowingly, with good intention." One is tempted to suggest an oral interference here, and if there were no <hi rend="italic">h-</hi>, we could render 'ê scïant' to indicate elision.</note>
<note target="#b759" type="edit" resp="#LZM">759] MS: alot; probably missing the abbreviation for "n"; cf. lines 1013, 7909, for forms of "aler" plus the present participle; so here would read alo<ex rend="angle">n</ex> t devisant, 'as they were setting up'.</note>
     <note target="#b779" type="edit" resp="#LZM">779] This is an extremely long line (6+10 or 11+5), though equal in meaning and form to that in Turin (773). It seems almost to be two lines run together; the hemistich divider is after <hi rend="italic">tëre</hi>.</note>
     <note target="#b782" type="interp" resp="#LZM">782] <hi rend="italic">habit'</hi>: this is the only appearance of the abbreviation after <hi rend="italic">t</hi> in this MS. It is difficult to know how to resolve the abbreviation; the apostrophe is a generic sort of abbreviation (see list in the introduction). The line is quite long, 4+8 without resolving it. The only form of <hi rend="italic">habit*</hi> as a noun that appears within a line (that is, not in rhyme) is <hi rend="italic">habitance</hi>, which appears 8 times, 3 not in rhyme and 5 in rhyme. <hi rend="italic">Habite</hi> only appears as the 'clerical habit' so we resolve <hi rend="italic">habit[ance]</hi>, though not without hesitation, making the line 4+10 syllables, or 4+9 if synalepha between <hi rend="italic">qi en</hi> is presumed.</note>    
<note target="#b790" type="interp" resp="#LZM"> 790] MS: empial. Cf. vv. 47, 73, 373, etc., where we see <hi rend="italic">emp[er]ial</hi>. However, see <hi rend="italic">empir</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">PP</hi> (v. 4970) and the many other variants. As one of the most frequent words in epic vocabulary, it is greatly varied in rhyme. Furthermore, in Italian, "empio" means "irreligioso, sacrilego, profanatore" and "spietato, crudele" (Zingarelli) so while there is the hint of emperor, there is also the sense of merciless, sacrilegious ruler.</note>
 <note target="#b802" type="interp" resp="#LZM">802] <hi rend="italic">seinté</hi>: this seems to be a combination of "seinté" and "è," 'holiness is'.</note>
     <note target="#b810" type="edit" resp="#LZM">810] <hi rend="italic">m'en</hi>: the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is very evidently effaced, while all the other letters around it are clear; it is not evident whether or not the effacement is deliberate or the result of moisture, thus we include it.</note>
     <note target="#b818" type="lex" resp="#LZM">818] MS: abosdivoir. Cf. <hi rend="italic">EE: bosdeor</hi>; <hi rend="italic">GdA: bosder, bosdeor, bosdera, bosdie</hi>, etc.; Holtus (<hi rend="italic">Lexikalische</hi>, pp. 237-38).</note>
     <note target="#b843" type="edit" resp="#LZM">843] MS: lencline; T 837 <hi rend="italic">Lo [con]te</hi> s'enclina e baso-ly li pedy <hi rend="italic">alora</hi> [The count bowed and then kissed his [the king's] feet]</note>
     <note target="#b888" type="codic" resp="#LZM">888] MS: confortas ɾoe</note>
<note target="#b923" type="lex" resp="#LZM">923] <hi rend="italic">Tutore</hi>: cf. www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/tuttora_(Enciclopedia-Dantesca)/. Typical of Old Italian, found in Dante, the <hi rend="italic">Fiore</hi>, etc. Consulted Nov. 26, 2016.</note>
     <note target="#b947" type="edit" resp="#LZM">947] T 940-41 <hi rend="italic">Sì de zò molto pasa el zorno el sol devala /se questo derite, a le mie man morerite</hi>. [If about this much passes the day, the sun goes down / if you tell this, you will die at my hands.] MS: peust le ior. This seems to be a case of a missing abbreviation mark on the downstroke of the <hi rend="italic">p</hi>; <hi rend="italic">parue, paruit, parut</hi> each appear in the MS twice and four of those times with a designation of day (<hi rend="italic">l'aube</hi> (v. 6051); <hi rend="italic">le jor serin</hi> (12219); <hi rend="italic">le dis</hi> (7141); <hi rend="italic">en cil jorner</hi> (11714)), making this verb, 'to appear', the most logical emendation. The only time <hi rend="italic">peusent</hi> appears (6586) is as a modal verb, a form of <hi rend="italic">pouvoir</hi>. The section was clearly problematic also for T.</note>     
   <note target="#b941" type="lex" resp="#LZM">941] <hi rend="italic">baor</hi>: cf. T-L "baudor" (col. 887), with lenition of the intervocalic occlusive.</note>
   <note target="#b952" type="lex" resp="#LZM">9452] <hi rend="italic">hor</hi> cf. T-L "or, ëur," cols. 1163-64; Matsumura "or<hi rend="super">2</hi>, eur"; but T 945: <hi rend="italic">che cosa'l era, no[n] l'averia fato p[er] l'or d'una tore</hi> [what he was, not for the gold of a tower], that is, not for anything would the servant have gone toward (what seemed to be) the beggar.</note>
 <note target="#b954" type="edit" resp="#LZM">954] MS: il che. Alternate reading: <hi rend="italic">ch'e il diable traïtor. / Le ont...</hi> (that he is the traitor devil. / They chased him out...).</note>
<note target="#b960" type="ling" resp="#LZM">960] Note the Italianate construction of definite article + possessive.</note>
<note target="#b977" type="interp" resp="#LZM">977] <hi rend="italic">haïr</hi>: this could be <hi rend="italic">haïr</hi>, anger, but we are interpreting it as "air" to go with the Turin reading and also the sense here: out the window and into the air, the sky.</note>
 <note target="#1019" type="lex" resp="#LZM">1019] <hi rend="italic">biendir</hi> appears in the Modern Italian "benedire" (documented before 1321, Dante, DELI), 'invocare la protezione divina su qc. o su q.c.' [to invoke divine protection on something or someone] ; and (documented before 1306 in Jacopone, DELI), 'lodare, esaltare' [to praise, exalt]. This appears a total of nine times in the MS; elsewhere, one finds 'to speak well' or a similar construction (see vv. 2196, 2674, 4244, 7392, 7274, 8173, 8483, 8727), which we distinguish by representing as two separate words.</note>

<note target="#b1062" type="trans" resp="#LZM">1062] This laisse is included in Tobler, p. 615. He does not always resolve abbreviations as here, always using "n" for the titulus indicating a nasal. There are no substantial differences in transcription.</note>

   <note target="#b1183" type="interp" resp="#LZM">1183] <hi rend="italic">Ongrie</hi>: in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Anjou cultivated an aura of holiness, and that included their Hungarian branch. Charles I of Anjou's second wife, Marguerite of Burgundy-Tonnerre, retired to Tonnerre in 1285 at her husband's death and founded a hospital there, where she, with two relatives, did works of charity and participated in prayer. Marie of Hungary (1257-1323), the wife of Charles I's son, Charles II (the Lame), also had a reputation for religious devotion, contributing to convents and churches. Her daughter Margaret married Charles of Valois and thus co-founded the Valois dynasty; the French monarchy was cultivating their holy links through the Capets, Anjou, and Plantagenets, so as part of the origins of the French royal dynasty, Hungary fits with Jerusalem and Rome as part of Huon's pilgrimage route. </note>

The people (or their spokesperson) are using "tu" with Huon, so it seems unlike that this is "seré" = 'by us you will be honored'; perhaps this is the "tu" form. On the other hand, using a conjugated verb after a preposition is also unlikely; see Turin, "<hi rend="italic">mostra-ne</hi> la via p[er]ché seremo tuty salve" [show us the way so that we will all be saved], where the conjunction is used.

 <note target="#b3740" type="lex" resp="#LZM">3740] <hi rend="italic">ferir</hi>: the meaning here is one that differs in OF and OI; while the OF meaning remains close to the Latin stem, with "schlagen, treffen" [strike, hit] (T-L, col. 1733), the Italian "ferire" diverged early to meaning "colpire causando una ferita" [to hit causing a wound] DELI 1219), "addolorare con atti e con parole" [to distress with deeds and words] DELI 1294), so this may mean a more general harm or punishment than striking the ex-pirates who had abandoned Huon to whatever might happen when he went exploring. There seems in fact to have been some confusion; see the reading of T 3703:cristiany sono ancora; gran <hi rend="italic">ben far porano</hi> [They are still Christians; then can do great good], where the rest of the segment reads very similarly to B.</note>

<note target="#b3852" type="interp" resp="#LZM">3852] This is a very Italian episode; the city-states in the Peninsula regularly exiled members of a losing party, who then ran coups from neighboring cities. The Medicis, for example, in 1433, were exiled from Florence, only to return the following year after a change of government. The constant wars of the fourteenth century in the northern Italian Peninsula reflected the various parties representing different interests changing allies and strength.</note>

The sense would seem to indicate that Huon informs himself of the reason for the dispute by speaking with a local person. Whether the abbreviated "p" here in B indicates some form of parler with a missing "l" or not is not evident.There are no other forms of parler without the "l" so we are leaving the line as it stands.</note>

Should the two lines be divided differently however, and "foy" be understood as Italian 'fede',  it could mean "Thus the people remained in that faith; / they gave their hearts completely to doing good" but "remist a" would be an unusual construction. It appears in collections of proverbs, and is rendered as a version of the Golden Rule, "do as you would be done by"; quoted in  https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_ledGIas0ZSQC/page/n23/mode/2up?q=nolit+fieri, p. 11 number 60 (accessed 29 August 2021).</note>

   <note target="#b4703" type="refer" resp="#LZM">4703] Catchword after this line: A Ynide. At this point begins the inserted signature, and Turin differs. It is clear that there is a problem in sense; there are supposedly five messengers, of whom two are mentioned in Turin (vv. 5652-53), these first two here; they are sent to Ynide and she rejects them in two laisses that are not present here. The ambassadors complete an initial embassy that is refused, and then at line T 4706, the equivalent of B 4704 picks up. Among those mentioned with the ambassadors, at various points, are 15 names: Ruçer/Rugier; Teris; Henri/Enri d'Aubespine; Belençer (marchis); Morant d'Autefoie (relative of Rugier and the Archbishop); Gui de Barcelune; Conte Gallerant d'Arthois; duc Tholomeu/Tholomeis; Uger de la Savine; Gauter de Clervant (queens); the Archbishop of Mainz (Maance); Saudin; Aumeri; Galerains de Bertagne; and Riçars, le sir de Normandie.

   <note target="#b4704" type="interp" resp="#LZM">4704] The previous line, at the end of folio 32V, ends with the catchwords <hi rend="italic">A Ynide</hi> which do not then begin the next folio or signature. These first two lines are problematic also, since a verb is missing; there should be something like "There is" or "There was." There is a space in the MS after "arcives" that seems to be scraped; it looks like <hi rend="italic">qe</hi>. With ultraviolet, one can almost see "q" and "e", and maybe something above the line too, "qe" with "u" above the line? Or just a bit of chalk solution or whatever they used. The line has far too many syllables, yet the word is missing its ending. Thus we give this as an emendation. Stengel ("Eine weitere," p. 39): L'Arcives[ch].</note>

For the meaning here, see note with line 2407. As for the form, in northern Italian, due to the widespread loss of atonic vowels, consonant groups coming together fostered the development of anaptyctic vowels, even in initial position, particularly when voiced consonants were together; thus for example, Jacopone da Todi, "armane" for<hi rend="italic">rimane</hi> (Rohlfs ¶ 338).</note>

     <note target="#b4745" type="codic" resp="#LZM">4745] The reading <hi rend="Italic">Tholomé</hi> here is problematic, since Tholomeus has not been designated head of the band of ambassadors or otherwise much discussed until now. MS T, line 4745, reads "Servire debe esere tal sire [et] de grande [et] <hi rend="italic">de menore</hi>"  [such a man should be lord both of great and of lesser men]; perhaps the original here was "tal ome" (such a man), referring to the king, referring to the king. There are two possible avenues for distraction, the first written, and the second oral. In the first column of this folio, in line four (this is line 3 of column two) in line 4707, "Tholomeu" appears, so could have distracted a copyist. If the scribe were writing under dictation, he might have thought he heard "tol ome" instead of "tel ome," and would have added the "h" after the "t" because he had just encountered the name earlier [with thanks to colleagues for confirmation]. However, the redactor was quite familiar with the <hi rend="Italic">Roman d'Alexandre</hi>, as Meregazzi and Morgan demonstrate, so this may on the contrary be a reference to the Ptolomies of Egypt; see note in translation. </note>

     <note target="#b5430" type="lex" resp="#LZM">5430] This line is somewhat problematic, evoking different reactions in those thinking of Italian and those thinking of French.<hi rend="italic">trasumans</hi> recalls Dante <hi rend="italic">Par</hi>. 1, 70, "transumanar." This would be one of its earliest usages after Dante (DELI: before 1321, Dante, first use) if that is what it is. Certainly Turin seems to have interpreted it as Dante's lexeme: 5240 <hi rend="italic">ch'el s'è partỳ</hi> p[er] desopra e straformò-se [he left for above and transformed himself]. But as PEB points out, "de suor" is 'with sweat' (cf. vv. 2504, 5027, 6821) so the preceding word could be a rendering for "tressüer," 'to sweat in big drops'. The "suelee" then would remain to solve; there is no similar expression in the MS. <hi rend="italic">svelee</hi>: there are forms of "svelleir," 'to be awake, to awaken', and that seems most likely here. Cf. 5434 below.</note>
 <note target="#b5432" type="interp" resp="#LZM">5432] Note that here Ynide anticipates the cries of those in hell; see v. 7661, 8848, etc., reflecting too the later comment that life is a is a purgatory for those who suffer it (v. 2398), and the self-beating repeats Huon's gesture to himelf before the temptation of the sorceress (laisses 269-70, vv. 6882-6929).</note>
   <note target="#b5439" type="interp" resp="#LZM">5439] Ynide's men include her relatives and various vassals. Twelve names appear: Alisant d'Aquitaine; Galudins, the porter; Thomas, Baudoin, Berart, her relatives; Ulien/Elin; Teris; Gauter d'Estampes; Robert and Anseis; Corberan and Sanguin. There are also a few minor figures: Grailet, Melians e Gralant. The name Morant appears on both sides: among Huon's men and with the ambassadors. There are also multiple appearances of "Teris" and "Thomas" in various forms.</note>
     <note target="#b5443" type="interp" resp="#LZM">5443] One wonders about the significance of the holy figure here.

Saint Mary Magdalene," <hi rend="italic">Jacobus de Voragine: The Golden Legend, Readings on the Saints</hi>, trans. Granger, pp. 374-83, at p. 395. Perhaps Ynide is attempting to imply to Charles Martel's representatives that she has repented of her disobedience. Mary Magdalene's feast day is July 22, so it may be merely a mark of time.</note>
    <note target="#b5445" type="codic" resp="#LZM">5445] Saint Helen was the mother of Constantine, who went to Jerusalem and the toured the Holy Land, supposedly discovering the True Cross. She also founded and beautified various churches. She brought various relics back to Rome, and down the street from St. John in Lateran is her Basilica of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, where her head graces a classical statue, near the Aurelian walls. The floor was originally with dirt brought back from the Holy Land; thus perhaps the appropriateness of such a site here for Ynide's prayer and its particular appeal to Christ.</note>

As frequently is the case for problematic lines, it is missing from the T version. <hi rend="italic">devaine</hi>: unclear origin; perhaps "devant" in rhyme? By context, this relates to the first sin, original sin, and it is translated. This line is missing from the Turin version.</note>

Alternatively, since the MS writes "levoit" as one word, it could mean "when the priest raised the great lord", but what else could "magne sire" refer to? However, the archbishop is nowhere else called a "great lord." Or perhaps "And when she saw him, the priest, the great lord," but then why the "And" that begins the line? Clearly, there seems to have been a bit of a confusion here in these two-three lines in the tradition.</note>

Ohly notes that the use of the formula as typical of the Germanic area, and suggests that its use in the <hi rend="italic">Chanson de Roland</hi> shows the martyrs of Roncevaux as saints to be prayed to (p. 68).

The expression appears subsequently in histories and in various Latin poems. It could be that "magnum" reflects the responsory here.

II/372; he notes in his glossary, "unclear" and refers to his note; Beretta, v. 6009, gives "asoil"  in his edition, saying that until it is clear to what tradition the line refers no conclusive  meaning can be assigned (373 n6009). Possibly the combination "asoilveç" could be a form of  "assoudre," 'absolve', but then the person of the verb is not comprehensible. And in the MS "veç" is written a little apart from the previous word.</note>

Line 7701 has no equivalent in T. The three lines 7701-7703 refer to the episode in the illumination at the bottom of the page, where burning masses fall into water, and spirits are led along the side of the stream; the language seems to be corrupted. Compare T 7383: Vite un monte che tuto se corla e tuto <hi rend="italic">brusa</hi> [He saw a mountain that shakes all over and burns all over], for B 7702; there is no equivalent to 7701. Perhaps it means "He called on God, Holding the cross in his hand the whole time." In line 7702, the word "sevre" or "seure" could be related to "(es)sever," 'drain, channel, ditch' from 'to stream out, flow away' (similar to Modern English "sewer"). Cf. Matsumura, "essee":  "canal d'écoulement." Stengel ("Huons Suche," p. 21): Si l'avoit seüré [...] qui crolle. In fact there would seem to be a confusion of what is illustrated here: burning masses appear from v. 7365 to 7398 (v. 51V, where the illumination instead is of the divided humans, vv. 7349-62); the griffons ultimately lift Huon and his horse to the other side.</note>

<note target="#b8370" type="interp" resp="#LZM">8370] This line is missing from T. The first hemistich is problematic; it is grammatical, but knowing how to fish and not getting anything though they know how is a little strange. Perhaps it was something with "avoir à" originally; "A pescher s'avomes," "We must fish" [...]. "se" as pronoun for the first person plural is well-documented (see Wunderli, "Se omnipersonnel dans <hi rend="italic">L'Aquilon de Bavière</hi>"). Rohlfs (¶702) gives examples of "avere" with an infinitive without a preposition, but it is unclear to him and also from the examples whether an "a" is assimilated into either the conjugated verb or the dependent infinitive. He notes that in northern Italy various verbs are used with infinitive meaning "dovere," but gives no examples with "avere." Since the hemistich does make sense as it stands we have not separated a pronoun from the verb, but suggest this alternative meaning. The situation is a Tantalus-type torture for the fallen angels.</note>

"Ensavir" can mean 'to instruct, teach' (T-L ensagir, col. 506), and the MS reads ensaves written together; a change of conjugation in rhyme position is not unique. This continues the question in the previous hemistich, "do you know anything about my quest?" so perhaps there are two possible meanings: either "Why do you know nothing?" or "Why do you explain nothing?". We here opt for the second. The line is 6'+6 syllables; Stengel presumes various sauts, perhaps based upon T's version.</note>

Here, it is engraved, according to the following lines, so a writing surface is needed. Neither B's form nor T's appear in RIALFrI as of this date (December 2021), and it is a hapax in this text.

     Mainone (<hi rend="italic">Laut</hi>, p. 16), suggests that it is from the Greek κεραύνια (light bulb?); Scattolini: ceran. T-LFI suggests "serran", an enclosed place; perhaps 'grove'? But again, there is no other example (in RIALFrI 'seran' is equivalent to: 'sera'; 'serena/o'; 'saranno'; 'serrando', no nouns other than 'sera', 'evening'). As Scattolini points out, there is no OF verb "peoner"; it is an adjective or substantive only  (T-L cols. 690-691).

<note target="#b9468" type="refer" resp="#LZM">9468] Cf. Dante, <hi rend="italic">Inf.</hi> 2.13; according to tradition, Aeneas had a son after his death, whom his wife bore in the woods, so named him "Silvius." Various Latin historians give "Aeneas Silvius" as the son of Silvius (Livy, <hi rend="italic">Ab urbe conditor</hi> 1.3; Dionysius of Helicarnassus, <hi rend="italic">Antiquitates romanae</hi> 1.71, Perseus); according to the same historians, his successor was Latinus Silvius. In any case, the descendants of the rulers of the Trojan settlement took the cognomen "Silvius" attached to personal names. Here then the "Silvian" seems to refer to the family line initiated by Aeneas's father, Anchises, whom Aeneas brought with him away from Troy. The father did not make it to the Italian peninsula.

 <note target="#b9572" type="refer" resp="#LZM">9572] For <hi rend="italic">robist</hi> (T-L rubist, col. 1529), see (<hi rend="italic">Lexikalische</hi>, p. 431) who suggests a derivation from Italian RUPES, producing a landscape element, which he also says is not always clearly identifiable from the context
   (<hi rend="italic">Lexikalische</hi>, p. 431). However, "robestre" the adjective also appears in F-I for "wild"; see the same page for Holtus, <hi rend="italic">EE</hi>. As an adjective, the <hi rend="italic">GdA</hi> defines it 'robusto' [strong/fierce]. For <hi rend="italic">fagon</hi>, <hi rend="italic">GdA</hi> gives "facion: .... fazione, l'insieme di schiere di soldati." Mainone is unclear as to the meaning; he notes that it is not French, and relates it to earlier appearances such as those mentioned, suggesting that all are based on the landscape feature (<hi rend="italic">GdA</hi>, 'côteau escarpé' [steep hillside], and but also notes the adjective "wild" [Fr. "rubeste," Ital "rubesto"; T-L rubeste, col. 1525], related earlier to rivers (<hi rend="italic">Laut</hi>, pp. 30-31). He then suggests that <hi rend="italic">fagon</hi> is like 'fango', 'mud' in the other versions. T-L defines "fouc" (with an unvoiced instead of a voiced consonant) as 'Schar' [crowd, host], but if that's the case, there is no element relating the word to the preceding one, so <hi rend="italic">robist</hi> might be an adjective deformed for rhyme. Previous lines mention a stone being loosed from above causing fear (9568-9569). Perhaps "Those of the muddy abyss"? Note that this and the next line were problematic for the poet, both with truncated finals and with no exact correspondence in the other versions. </note>

The 'mo' of <hi rend="italic">mort</hi> in the next line has been edited. Scattolini does not emend. Scattolini suggests that the <hi rend="italic">blasfemant</hi> in the following line is an error, repeating the verb of this line. However, that is not necessarily the case, since repeating the term creates a certain rhythm reflective of prayers– in the contrary sense. One can invoke St. Francis's "Beato si..." or various Latin prayers, like the Beatitudes, for positive examples.</note>

The gate figure holds a book with black dots on it. "The figure on the tower will be Tholomé; what he is holding looks like an unbound book, or possibly a single sheet; possibly a map of the heavens; on the left side the half-circle showing may be part of a representation of the course of the stars; on the right the dots all round the edge of the page may represent stars in the center of which is something that looks like an astronomical instrument (part of an astrolabe?)" (PEB). Note that the tower is square, suggesting that <hi rend="italic">reont</hi> refers to something else. <hi rend="italic">Charere</hi> (line 9915) means both 'chair'  (<hi rend="italic">cattedra</hi> in MSI) and 'highway' in this text, as confirmed by other F-I texts. In fact, the gateway is rounded and the human figure is at the highest point. Since this is a scholar with a book, it makes the most sense for him to be in a chair or seat. The portion remaining in the Turin MS (folio 146R) shows a loggia with rounded openings to the left of the illumination, with the three travellers outside to the left. One figure inside (with a fancy headdress) is on a chair with a baldacchino in a polygonal shape (not quite a circle, but circular) above. Since the walls in the Berlin MS illumination reach outside the frame, there is nothing above the figure who is on top of the gate there. It is unclear therefore whether the Turin version is a variation of meaning, but in any case, it is one possible explanation of <hi rend="italic">reont</hi>. </note>

Note that in Br this is a "carte de Iometrie" (v. 1113) followed directly by Huon's question to Aeneas, here v. 10005. Scattolini suggests that there seems to be an entire line missing following this one: this one is exactly parallel to the Br reading followed by "Llo bon conte U[gon] abraça et aplaine" which would obviate the need for presuming a blank in the middle of the following line ('The good count Huon embraced and caressed [aplanir] with his two arms Aeneas who led him').

   <note target="#b10329" type="interp" resp="#AEB">10329] Stengel ("Höllenfahrt," p. 68), Scattolini: Otisiaus. <hi rend="italic">Tisiaus</hi>: Tisias is reported to have been the first theoretician of rhetoric in ancient Greece. It is taken that he was the student of one Corax, who has left no written work. Tradition has it that, after the fall of the monarchy in Sicily in the 5th c. BCE, the rise of democracy occasioned a need for persuasive speech (command no longer being accepted). One successful Sicilian practitioner was Gorgias who went to Athens in 427 BCE, where he became a major figure among the Sophists. In the <title rend="italic">Gorgias</title>, Plato accused rhetoricians of favoring opinion over truth, success in the moment over enduring verities. (See also <title rend="italic">Phaedrus</title> 267a-b.) Thus, in the history of rhetoric, Tisias would stand in the same relationship to rhetoric as the Sophists to sophistry. Support for this view comes in the theory that Corax was not a separate person, but that the word, which means "crow" is actually a derogatory nickname for Tisias himself. Rhetoric received a higher standing with Aristotle, fascinated with how things break down into their component parts, who wrote his <title rend="italic">Rhetoric</title> as an analytical guide to, and practical manual for, the art—but he distinguished it from logic (dialectic). In the later Middle Ages, therefore, Tisias may be taken as a mythical founder, an archetype for all who indulge in untruth for emotional effect. Whatever his reputation in antiquity, in this passage, Berlin, lines 10324-10351, Tisias seems to represent all seven liberal arts (10328). The reference to his singing includes another of the seven: grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. 
     Major, "Epicharmus"; Hinks, "Tisias and Corax" (AEB). 
     Scattolini  mentions that he was part of the Sicilian School, and that the first treatise on rhetoric is attributed to him, giving the equivalents in other versions of Huon (<hi rend="italic">Ricerche sulla tradizione</hi>, p. 174 n57).</note>

   <note target="#b10335.1" type="interp" resp="#LZM">10335.1] This scene may refer to the beginning of the mass; at that era, the "introit involves the singing of a Psalm, which by this period would have been sung alternatingly by two choir bodies." It may be like improvisory practice where "one singer or group of singers would sing the original chant tune, and the other voices might improvise or sing composed counterpoint above it" and "vocal polyphony was used during mass, often with a low line carrying the chant tune, and upper voices providing countermelodies, improvised or otherwise." Where and when it was done and if the celebrant was involved would be difficult to verify since the specific origin of this story is not known. We thank Remi Chiu (Fine Arts (Music), LUM) his collaboration. We also thank Francesca Gambino (Filologia romanza, Dipartimento di Studi Linguistici e Letterari (DISSL), U. of Padova), who points out that "abis" as an adverb could reflect the verb "abesse"  ("abaisser") in line 10333, "low(er)." "bis" in its modern sense first appears in the nineteenth century according to DEAF. See also P, vv. 4795-99.

Looking elsewhere in the text we find "moit" (v. 7121) from "to move"; Matsumura lists "amovoir" but not reflexive form; T-L lists a possibly reflexive "movoir." If this were the case, it would signify "to gesticulate" as the text suggests already when he begs for pardon (v. 10730). The following tears and frequent expressions elsewhere about his dampening himself with tears make dampening seem more attractive as a possibility. An equivalent line is missing from Turin.
