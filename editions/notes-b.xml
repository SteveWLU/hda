 <note target="#b1" type="trans" resp="#LZM">1] Holtus ("Considerazioni") published lines 1-109; his edition is a diplomatic one (45-48), with abbreviations reproduced and word divisions as in the manuscript. Tobler ("Berliner") published lines 1-111 (pp. 617-19); he reproduces the text without punctuation other than the final periods and the lines that mark caesura here at the beginning of the poem, and without distinguishing <hi rend="italic">u/v</hi>.</note>
 <note target="#b9" type="lex" resp="#LZM">9] <hi rend="italic">chadel</hi>: cf. Holtus, <hi rend="italic">Lexikalische</hi>, p. 254, Rinoldi, "I manoscritti franco-italiani," p. 44, and here, <hi rend="italic">chaelle</hi>, v. 11605.</note>
 <note target="#b12" type="codic" resp="#LZM">12] MS: une (final -<hi rend="italic">e</hi> is expunctuated)</note>
<note target="#b21" type="edit" resp="#LZM">21] The initial here is very faded; the external background is gold, the internal illustration is red with a figure inside, so the original would seem to be blue, though it is currently faded and purplish.</note>
 <note target="#b55" type="codic" resp="#LZM">55] MS: quilens or quueus with <hi rend="italic">il</hi> or second <hi rend="italic">u</hi> expunctuated (the second stroke is a bit longer than the first); the line is one syllable too long, with the hemistich divider after <hi rend="italic">ferté</hi>.</note>
 <note target="#b76" type="trans" resp="#LZM">76] Tobler omits the superscript after <hi rend="italic">.iiii.</hi>; Holtus seems to have a small <hi rend="italic">m</hi> over the roman numeral. This MS abbreviation appears only with <hi rend="italic">.iiii.</hi> (six times) and would seem to be validated by line 6271, when in a prayer Christ arose after 4 days; and in line 11057, where four men are chosen as electors for the king to replace Charles Martel, and listed immediately thereafter. Furthermore, the <hi rend="italic">m</hi> in lines 9334 and 11496 has no final upstroke.</note>
 <note target="#b78" type="codic" resp="#LZM">78] MS: vieg with final -<hi rend="italic">e</hi> above the line.</note> 
 <note target="#b86" type="interp" resp="#LZM">86] <hi rend="italic">ster</hi>: seems to here be a conjugated verb. Cf forms <hi rend="italic">stent</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ster</hi> (these last as infinitives) in the poem.</note>
 <note target="#b97" type="lex" resp="#LZM">97] <hi rend="italic">sorage</hi>: 'brother-in-law' (T-L <hi rend="italic">serorge</hi>).</note>
 <note target="#b106" type="edit" resp="#LZM">106] MS: Une hostel; T 106 reads <hi rend="italic">una chasa che Ynida l</hi>a vite de longo [a house that Ynide saw from afar]; a similar original might be the reason for the form here. However, <hi rend="italic">une</hi> acts as a masculine article in other cases; cf. <hi rend="italic">Une almansor, une rame</hi>, etc., as well as a pronoun (e.g., 8366, <hi rend="italic">Une</hi> in reference to <hi rend="italic">torment</hi>).</note>
<note target="#b109" type="trans" resp="#LZM">109] End of Holtus's diplomatic transcription ("Considerazioni").</note>
<note target="#b111" type="trans" resp="#LZM">111] End of Tobler's edited selection ("Berliner").</note>
 <note target="#b136" type="codic" resp="#LZM">136] <hi rend="italic">ce</hi> is inserted above the line after <hi rend="italic">Por</hi>, with a caret below the line. <hi rend="italic">Torner</hi>: cf. Gambino, “Code-mixing nel <hi rend="italic">Bovo</hi>,” <hi rend="italic">tornier</hi>, p. 79.</note>
 <note target="#b139" type="edit" resp="#LZM">139] MS is missing a word for 'horse'; since the phrase is a fixed formula (see vv. 1182, 7290, 7297), here we insert <hi rend="italic">civals</hi> to accord with two of the other three uses of <hi rend="italic">crenu</hi> and its forms. <hi rend="italic">Destrer</hi> would be another possibility.</note>
 <note target="#b167" type="interp" resp="#LZM">167] In B <hi rend="italic">lou</hi> normally means either 'place' (ModFr <hi rend="italic">lieu</hi>) or 'the' (ModFr <hi rend="italic">le</hi>); here it is 'là où'. T 168: luy et Ugon.</note>
 <note target="#b168" type="interp" resp="#LZM">168]<hi rend="italic">timbre</hi>: it is unclear what this is; 'psaltery', not what one normally expects for a call to fight, is the first definition (Matsumura). However, one also finds 'drum' and 'tamburine' (T-L, col. 307). T 169: <hi rend="italic">el feze i lifante e le c</hi>inbale sonare.</note>
 <note target="#b185" type="edit" resp="#LZM">185] <hi rend="italic">chacer</hi>: the first <hi rend="italic">c</hi> has a red <hi rend="italic">x</hi> within the loop.</note> 
 <note target="#b200" type="interp" resp="#LZM">200] This line is problematic for sense; T 199 zascun de lor à ben le so<ex rend="angle"> v</ex>o abatude, is also unclear; it seems to be, "each of their people defeated his man" (<hi rend="italic">a' l</hi> = Italian 'ha il', with an Italian style possessive); alternatively, <hi rend="italic">abatus</hi> may be intended as a conjugated verb, but the meaning would be the similar.</note>
 <note target="#b231" type="interp" resp="#LZM">231] <hi rend="italic">pis</hi>: the reading is clear in the MS; yet see T 230: <hi rend="italic">fora solamente qu</hi>ando el vole dal re lo presio [except when he wanted reward from the king].</note>
 <note target="#b234" type="interp" resp="#LZM">234] T 233 does not include the same wording, but rather: <hi rend="italic">se fereno</hi> de coro e de fede [they hit each other spiritedly and in good faith]; <hi rend="italic">pis</hi>: T-L <hi rend="italic">piz</hi>, 'Brust des Menschen' [human chest]).</note> 
 <note target="#b245" type="codic" resp="#LZM">245] <hi rend="italic">reuser</hi>: reculer (Matsumura). Cf. <hi rend="italic">GdA</hi>, 'rovesciare, respingere' [to knock over, push back]; T-L <hi rend="italic">reüser</hi> (‘zurücktreiben’ [to drive back, repel; rebuff; avoid, get out of the way; to retreat, back off]). .</note>
 <note target="#b262" type="interp" resp="#LZM">262] Laisse 10: the metrics of this laisse require that the final -<hi rend="italic">re</hi> not be counted, which makes almost all lines regular. This is like unstressed feminine <hi rend="italic">e</hi> endings elsewhere in the poem, as in the following laisse.</note>
<note target="#b320" type="interp" resp="#LZM">320] <hi rend="italic">engoler</hi>: Cf. Holtus <hi rend="italic">Aliscans</hi> v. 7560.</note>
 <note target="#b321" type="lex" resp="#LZM">321] <hi rend="italic">tornoier</hi>: cf. Gambino, "Code-mixing nel <hi rend="italic">Bovo</hi>," p. 79, <hi rend="italic">tornier</hi>.</note> 
 <note target="#b339" type="lex" resp="#LZM">339] <hi rend="italic">engajer</hi>: 'engage', as security, in case of misbehavior; cf. <hi rend="italic"> Guiron</hi>, https://www.rialfri.eu/rialfriPHP/public/testo/testo/ordinata/ot|rialfri|guironMarciano|001|12229/query/l#mark, 15 August 2022; <hi rend="italic">EE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">engajés, engajees</hi>, also RIALFrI, 15 August 2022. </note>
 <note target="#b349" type="lex" resp="#LZM">349] <hi rend="italic">quitement</hi>: cf. RIALFrI, <hi rend="italic">Dizionario, quite</hi> (https://www.rialfri.eu/en/dizionario/q/quite-agg, consulted 04 Feb 2023). </note> 
 <note target="#b358" type="lex" resp="#LZM">358] <hi rend="italic">saie</hi>: this is wool cloth. Cf. T 355: <hi rend="italic">d’una chiar</hi>a saia de grana che resplende [in a bright twill of shining red]. DELI gives <hi rend="italic">saia</hi> as ‘twill’, and the <hi rend="italic">Vocabolario degli accademici della Crusca</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">grana</hi> as ‘red’ (verified 22 Jan 2023).</note>
 <note target="#b369" type="codic" resp="#LZM">369] MS: c<hi rend="super">i</hi>ne; what seems to be an <hi rend="italic">i</hi> above the line between <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi></note>
 <note target="#b393" type="lex" resp="#LZM">393] Cf. T 390: <hi rend="italic">a tova corte</hi>: più e più stano come mute [at your court many of them are as if silent]; perhaps the line here could be understood <hi rend="italic">enmue</hi>, a sight rhyme (T-L <hi rend="italic">enmüir</hi> (= <hi rend="italic">amüir</hi>), 'verstummen' [to become silent, fall silent]), and that is how T understood it. But given that the next line says that their beauty has not been visible, the interpretation of their being away somewhere out of sight seems more logical.</note>
 <note target="#b402" type="lex" resp="#LZM">402] <hi rend="italic">vancel</hi>: see T-L <hi rend="italic">vanerie</hi>; cf. Petit Robert <hi rend="italic">vanne</hi> (dated 1274).</note>
 <note target="#b405" type="interp" resp="#LZM">405] For the forms <hi rend="italic">glese, glesse, glesie</hi>, see Holtus (<hi rend="italic">Lexikalische</hi>, p. 341).</note>
<note target="#b415" type="edit" resp="#LZM">415] MS: ia belist. <hi rend="italic">belist</hi> is a hapax. Elsewhere in the text, we find <hi rend="italic">abellir; abelist; abelli</hi>, e.g., vv. 4168, 6320, etc.</note>
 <note target="#b419" type="interp" resp="#LZM">419] Cf. T 416 <hi rend="italic">saludò ley dizendo: "Quel magno Redentore</hi> [he greeted her saying, "That great Redeemer..."]</note>
 <note target="#b439" type="codic" resp="#LZM">439-440] These two lines have a special handle at the start, a sort of manicule, in red before 439, in blue before 440 (see Clemens and Graham, <hi rend="italic">Manuscript Studies</hi>, p. 44-45). There is a note in the left margin before them, between the two, that reads .not. with a line above that has a little hump in it just past the middle (folio 4R, to the left, 10-11 lines from the bottom of the written column): <hi rend="italic">notat</hi>, commenting on the proverbial expression (Capelli, <hi rend="italic">Dizionario</hi>, p. 240, for "not" with an abbreviation line). </note>
 <note target="#b498" type="lex" resp="#LZM">498] <hi rend="italic">gamentoit</hi>: Cf. <hi rend="italic">EE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">gaumenter</hi> (T-L <hi rend="italic">gaimenter</hi>), but also 9746 here, <hi rend="italic">gamenta de soit</hi> [he complained of thirst]. It is possible that this is a combination of <hi rend="italic">gemere</hi> [to weep, lament] that DELI dates before Dante, before 1321, plus <hi rend="italic">lamentare</hi>, or possibly with a frequentative created on <hi rend="italic">gemito</hi>, the past participle of <hi rend="italic">gemere</hi>.</note>
 <note target="#b508" type="edit" resp="#LZM">508]There is an <hi rend="italic">X</hi> in the right margin in light brown ink, perhaps inserted by a nineteenth-century reader; see also note to v. 545.</note>
 <note target="#b533" type="interp" resp="#LZM">533] <hi rend="italic">hastivement</hi>: there seems to be a problem with the tradition at this point; T 528 reads (according to Rajna) <hi rend="italic">studevelmente</hi>.</note>
 <note target="#b542" type="codic" resp="#LZM">542] MS: g<hi rend="super">u</hi>amēt, with a side-ways <hi rend="italic">u</hi> over <hi rend="italic">g</hi> toward the <hi rend="italic">m</hi>; <hi rend="italic">gaiment, guaiment</hi> (T-L 45, lines 45 ff); cf. above, v. 498, <hi rend="italic">gamentoit</hi>.</note>
 <note target="#b545" type="codic" resp="#LZM">542] There is an <hi rend="italic">X</hi> to the left of the beginning of this line. It is not clear whether that refers to this line, or to the line in the previous column, v. 508.</note> 
 <note target="#b549" type="lex" resp="#LZM"> 549] <hi rend="italic">atent</hi>: this has been one of the most discussed lexical items between French and Italian speakers. In Italian <hi rend="italic">attenere</hi> (DELI, intransitive, beg. 14th century) is defined as 'spettare, concernere', and that is clearly the meaning here: 'belong to you, concern you'.</note>
 <note target="#b565" type="codic" resp="#LZM">565] <hi rend="italic">le lor</hi>: this is generally a possessive pronoun or adjective, but appears here as one of the several pronominal usages, ‘them’. Cf. T560: <hi rend="italic">e possa guardò avante, luy no[n] li vite afora lor</hi> [and then he looked forward, he didn't see anyone there except them]. </note>
  <note target="#b610" type="interp" resp="#LZM">610] Alternate reading: si l'afier spiera [if they suspect the affair/event]; cf. T 605: se l'afar spiarà [if he hears of the affair/event].</note>
 <note target="#b616" type="interp" resp="#LZM">616] <hi rend="italic"><ex rend="angle">a</ex> Deu plest</hi>: cf. T 611 se a Dio piaze bon [con]seio se trovarà [if it pleases God, good advice will be found]. The B line is short one syllable, so the emendation is logical, though constructions without <hi rend="italic">a</hi> for <hi rend="italic">*piacere</hi> appear elsewhere in the text: cf. v. 3186.</note>
  <note target="#b660" type="lex" resp="#LZM">660] <hi rend="italic">loër</hi>: T-L col 566, gewähren [grant, accord]</note>
<note target="#b669" type="edit" resp="#LZM">669] MS missing the abbreviation mark here in for a nasal in <hi rend="italic">acoplir</hi>; cf. vv. 1271, 1282, etc.</note>
 <note target="#b674" type="edit" resp="#LZM">674] MS: cōpli<hi rend="super">r</hi>a. The MS is difficult to read. It would seem that there is something above the line, above a scratchout, but the section is faded; perhaps <hi rend="italic">r</hi> for the combination in <hi rend="italic">complira</hi>. T 669: <hi rend="italic">aco[m]pirà</hi> [will fulfill].</note>
 <note target="#b701" type="lex" resp="#LZM">701] <hi rend="italic">le jugor</hi>: T 696 <hi rend="italic">vuy dovite e</hi>sere signore lo mazore [and you should be the greatest lord]. The B line seems an odd form; <hi rend="italic">vigor </hi> would not make sense in this section, though at first glance that seems to be the reading. Elsewhere <hi rend="italic">vigor</hi> is clearly paired with <hi rend="italic">force</hi> in a synonymic pair (vv. 936, 1838, 11743, 11929) or used after a preposition to indicate strength (vv. 6897, 9094).</note>
 <note target="#b704" type="interp" resp="#LZM">704] These lines are difficult to understand. In T 699, the verb is in the second plural, and <hi rend="italic">vuy</hi> is the subject: <hi rend="italic">a drito dovite e</hi>sere vuy de lor suo pastore [by right you should be their pastor/lord]. Perhaps it can be best understood as an aside to the councillors present. See the note in the translation. </note>
 <note target="#b712" type="lex" resp="#LZM">712] <hi rend="italic">cheste</hi>: this is a hapax, and in a construction much like the 25 forms of the noun <hi rend="italic">queste</hi> [quest], so intended as a rendering of that lexeme, rather than as a deictic pronoun in the Italian style.</note>
<note target="#b715" type="interp" resp="#LZM">715] <ex rend="angle">la</ex> added for sense and syllable count; cf. T 709: <ex rend="italic">lizeramente la</ex> porite vuy possa avere.</note> 
 <note target="#b751" type="codic" resp="#LZM">751] p<hi rend="italic">re</hi>gant: the <hi rend="italic">g</hi> has an unusual form; it looks more like a <hi rend="italic">y</hi>. The syllable count is 7+6. T 745: devotamente pregando Dio ch'e<hi rend="italic">l guarde da torme[n]to</hi> [devotedly praying (to) God that He guard him from torment]; here, one might omit <hi rend="italic">mal</hi> [devotedly praying (to) God that He guard him from torment], torment being bad by definition, to reduce to 7+5.</note>
 <note target="#b752" type="interp" resp="#LZM">752] <hi rend="italic"><ex rend="angle">e</ex> hescïant</hi>: cf. T 746: <hi rend="italic">a bona fede e yntenzione</hi> [with good faith and intention]; other appearances of <hi rend="italic">a (h)esiant/ (h)esient</hi> in B are a preposition with a noun, 'knowingly, with good intention'. One is tempted to suggest an oral interference here, and if there were no <hi rend="italic">h-</hi>, we could transcribe 'ê sciant' to indicate elision.</note>
 <note target="#b759" type="edit" resp="#LZM">759] MS: alot; probably missing the abbreviation for <hi rend="italic">n</hi>; cf. lines 1013, 7909, for forms of <hi rend="italic">aler</hi> and the present participle; so <hi rend="italic">alo<ex rend="angle">n</ex> t devisant</hi>, 'as they were setting up'.</note>
 <note target="#b779" type="edit" resp="#LZM">779] This is an extremely long line (6+10 or 11+5), though equal in meaning and form to that of T 773. It may be two lines run together; the hemistich divider is after <hi rend="italic">tëre</hi>.</note>
 <note target="#b782" type="interp" resp="#LZM">782] MS: habit': this is the only appearance of the abbreviation after <hi rend="italic">t</hi> in this MS. It is difficult to know how to resolve the abbreviation; the apostrophe is a generic sort of abbreviation (see Introduction). The line is quite long, 4+8 already, without resolving it. The only form of <hi rend="italic">habit*</hi> as a noun that appears within a line (that is, not in rhyme) is <hi rend="italic">habitance</hi>, which appears 8 times, 3 not in rhyme and 5 in rhyme. <hi rend="italic">Habite</hi> only appears as the 'clerical habit' so we resolve <hi rend="italic">habit[ance]</hi>, though not without hesitation, making the line 4+10 syllables, or 4+9 if synalepha between <hi rend="italic">qi en</hi> is presumed.</note> 
 <note target="#b790" type="interp" resp="#LZM"> 790] MS: empial. Cf. vv. 47, 73, 373, etc., where we see <hi rend="italic">emp[er]ial</hi>. However, see <hi rend="italic">empir</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">PP</hi> (v. 4970) and the many other variants. As one of the most frequent words in epic vocabulary, it varies greatly in rhyme. Furthermore, in Italian, <hi rend="italic">empio</hi> means 'irreligioso, sacrilego, profanatore' (DELI, attested bef. 1292) and 'spietato, crudele' (DELI, attested bef. 1321), so while there is the hint of 'emperor', there is also the sense of 'merciless, sacrilegious ruler'.</note>
 <note target="#b798" type="codic" resp="#LZM">798] MS: luc<hi rend="super">i</hi>bial; an <hi rend="italic">i</hi> inserted above the line between <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a</hi>with a caret below the line.</note>
 <note target="#b802" type="interp" resp="#LZM">802] <hi rend="italic">seinté</hi>: this seems to be a combination of <hi rend="italic">seinté</hi> and the verb <hi rend="italic">è</hi>, 'holiness is'.</note>
 <note target="#b810" type="edit" resp="#LZM">810] <hi rend="italic">m'en</hi>: the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is very evidently effaced, while all the other letters around it are clear; it is not evident whether or not the effacement is deliberate or the result of moisture, thus we include it. T 804 is not equivalent, so no help here.</note>
 <note target="#b818" type="lex" resp="#LZM">818] MS: abosdivoir. Cf. <hi rend="italic">EE: bosdeor</hi>; <hi rend="italic">GdA: bosder, bosdeor, bosdera, bosdie</hi>, etc.; Holtus (<hi rend="italic">Lexikalische</hi>, pp. 237-38).</note>
 <note target="#b843" type="edit" resp="#LZM">843] MS: lencline; T 837 <hi rend="italic">Lo [con]te</hi> s'enclina e baso-ly li pedy <hi rend="italic">alora</hi> [The count bowed and then kissed his [the king's] feet]. Cf. vv. 4530, 4453, 6665; the redactor or scribe seems to have difficulty between the pronominal form and transitive form of <hi rend="italic">encliner/incliner</hi>; or possibly the difference between <hi rend="italic">l</hi> and <hi rend="italic">s</hi> was difficult to discern at times. There also seems to be the issue of indicating 'he bowed to him / them'; B seems to prefer one personal object pronoun (while it does not mind the locative pronoun <hi rend="italic">y</hi> or <hi rend="italic">li</hi> with an object pronon) at a time before the verb. Here it is clearly Huon who is bowing, and thus the emendation.</note>
 <note target="#b888" type="codic" resp="#LZM">888] MS: confortas ɾoe; <hi rend="italic">q</hi> with an <hi rend="italic">i</hi> written above.</note>
 <note target="#b890" type="codic" resp="#LZM">890] MS: sponte with an <hi rend="italic">e</hi> written above the line between <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and a caret below the line after the <hi rend="italic">o</hi>.</note>
 <note target="#b923" type="lex" resp="#LZM">923] <hi rend="italic">Tutore</hi>: cf. www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/tuttora_(Enciclopedia-Dantesca)/. Typical of Old Italian, found in Dante's <hi rend="italic">Fiore</hi>, etc. Consulted 26 Nov. 2016.</note>
 <note target="#b941" type="lex" resp="#LZM">941] <hi rend="italic">baor</hi>: cf. T-L <hi rend="italic">baudor</hi> (col. 887), with lenition of the intervocalic occlusive.</note>
 <note target="#b947" type="edit" resp="#LZM">947] MS: peust le ior. T 940-41 <hi rend="italic">Sì de zò molto pasa el zorno el sol devala /se questo derite, a le mie man morerite</hi>. [If about this much passes the day, the sun goes down / if you tell this, you will die at my hands.] This seems to be a case of a missing abbreviation mark on the downstroke of the <hi rend="italic">p</hi>; <hi rend="italic">parue, paruit, parut</hi> each appear in the MS twice and four of those times with a designation of day (<hi rend="italic">l'aube</hi> (v. 6051); <hi rend="italic">le jor serin</hi> (v. 12219); <hi rend="italic">le dis</hi> (v. 7141); <hi rend="italic">en cil jorner</hi> (v. 11714)), making this verb, 'to appear', the most logical emendation. The only time <hi rend="italic">peusent</hi> appears (v. 6586) is as a modal verb, a form of <hi rend="italic">pouvoir</hi>. The section was clearly problematic also for T.</note>  
 <note target="#b952" type="lex" resp="#LZM">952] <hi rend="italic">hor</hi> cf. T-L <hi rend="italic">or, ëur</hi>, cols. 1163-64; Matsumura <hi rend="italic">or<hi rend="super">2</hi>, eur</hi>; but T 945: <hi rend="italic">che cosa'l era, no[n] l'averia fato p[er] l'or d'una tore</hi> [what he was, not for the gold of a tower], that is, not for anything would the servant have gone toward (what seemed to be) the beggar. Here, see v. 3604 for <hi rend="italic">hor</hi> as 'gold'.</note>
 <note target="#b954" type="edit" resp="#LZM">954] MS: il che; cf. T 947: <hi rend="italic">Veramente sapiate ch'el diavolo è traditore</hi>. Alternate reading here: <hi rend="italic">ch'e il diable traitor. / Le ont...</hi> [that the devil is a traitor. / They chased him out...].</note>

 <note target="#b2806" type="interp" resp="#LZM">2806] This line is problematic; it is not logical that Huon asks the women what to do next.

Perhaps the line should be emeded: "Com la fareç, ami?", or the final -<hi rend="italic">e</hi> of <hi rend="italic">amie</hi> represents an Italianate final vowel with the occlusive consonant lenited in intervocalic position, and the discourse is already directed to him.</note>
 <note target="#b2814" type="codic" resp="#LZM">2814] This line could be divided in two ways: after <hi rend="italic">senteç</hi> or as we do here.

However, he is already suffering and in pain so speaking of narrative sense, the relationship of between vv. 4232 and 4231 needs further explanation.</note>

 <note target="#b4716" type="interp" resp="#LZM">4716] The syllable count here is off, with 5+6, and the line is very different in T, so there seems to have been a problem in the tradition of the text.

  <note target="#b4727" type="lex" resp="#LZM">4727] <hi rend="italic">armaroit</hi>: in this text there are two meanings for forms of <hi rend="italic">remanoir</hi> that go beyond the literal 'to stay, to remain'). For the meaning here, see note, v. 2407. As for the form, in northern Italian, due to the widespread loss of atonic vowels, consonant groups coming together fostered the development of anaptyctic vowels, even in initial position, particularly when voiced consonants were together; thus for example, Jacopone da Todi, <hi rend="italic">armane</hi> for<hi rend="italic">rimane</hi> (Rohlfs vol. 1, ¶ 338).</note>

  <note target="#b4745" type="codic" resp="#LZM">4745] The reading <hi rend="Italic">Tholomé</hi> here is problematic, since Tholomeus has not been designated head of the band of ambassadors or otherwise much discussed until now. T 4745: Servire [emend: Servito] debe esere tal sire [et] de grande [et] <hi rend="italic">de menore</hi>" [such a lord should be served by both great and lesser men]; perhaps the original for B was *<hi rend="italic">tal ome</hi> (such a man), referring to the king. There are two possible avenues for distraction, the first written, and the second oral/aural. In the first column of this folio, in line four (this is line 3 of column two) in line 4707, <hi rend="italic">Tholomeu</hi> appears, so could have distracted a copyist. If the scribe were writing under dictation, he might have thought he heard "tol ome" instead of "tel ome," and would have added the <hi rend="italic">h</hi> after the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> because he had just encountered the name earlier [with thanks to colleagues for confirmation]. However, the redactor was quite familiar with the <hi rend="Italic">RdA</hi>, as Meregazzi and Morgan demonstrate, so this may on the contrary be a reference to the Ptolomies of Egypt; see note in translation. Yet note too that the syllable count is off here by one because of the stressed final of the name; if the line read "tal ome" instead, it would be 6'+6 instead of 7+6.</note>

This would be one of its earliest usages after Dante (DELI: before 1321, Dante, first use) if that is what it is.

But as PEB points out, "de suor" is 'with sweat' (cf. vv. 2504, 5027, 6821) so the preceding word could be a rendering for <hi rend="italic">tressüer</hi> [to sweat in big drops]. Then <hi rend="italic">suelee/svelee</hi> would remain to solve; there is no similar expression in the MS. There are forms of "svelleir," 'to be awake, to awaken', and that seems most likely here.

The expression appears subsequently in histories and in various Latin poems. It could be that "magnum" reflects the responsory here. It is part of matins, so would fit with the reference to "ancient prime" earlier (v. 5979). However, it could also refer to the archbishop's idea of himself as a great priest.

In line 7702, the word "sevre" or "seure" could be related to "(es)sever," 'drain, channel, ditch' from 'to stream out, flow away' (similar to Modern English "sewer"). Cf. Matsumura, "essee": "canal d'écoulement." Stengel ("Huons Suche," p. 21): Si l'avoit seüré [...] qui crolle. In fact there would seem to be a confusion of what is illustrated here: burning masses appear from v. 7365 to 7398 (v. 51V, where the illumination instead is of the divided humans, vv. 7349-62); the griffons ultimately lift Huon and his horse to the other side.</note>

The situation– affection for the departed, as in Vergil's <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 6 and in Ynide's visit from her father, with an inability to embrace– has created an overlap, making translation also difficult.

The first hemistich is problematic; it is grammatical, but knowing how to fish and not getting anything though they know how is a little strange. Perhaps it was something with "avoir à" originally; "A pescher s'avomes," "We must fish" [...]. "se" as pronoun for the first person plural is well-documented (see Wunderli, "Se omnipersonnel dans <hi rend="italic">L'Aquilon de Bavière</hi>"). Rohlfs (¶702) gives examples of "avere" with an infinitive without a preposition, but it is unclear to him and also from the examples whether an "a" is assimilated into either the conjugated verb or the dependent infinitive. He notes that in northern Italy various verbs are used with infinitive meaning "dovere," but gives no examples with "avere." Since the hemistich does make sense as it stands we have not separated a pronoun from the verb, but suggest this alternative meaning.

We here opt for the second. The line is 6'+6 syllables; Stengel presumes various sauts, perhaps based upon T's version.

 <note target="#b8415" type="lex" resp="#LZM">8415] <hi rend="italic">palastre</hi> does not appear in T-L as a noun in any sense that would seem to work here; there is an adjective meaning 'pusillanime', or a reference to "palestre," 'exercise field'; "palestrage," on the other hand, is 'lock casing'. DELI offers "pala," which among other definitions is a device to take things out of the oven (perhaps like a modern pizza peel?); -<hi rend="italic">astro</hi> is the suffix for "big and bad." Turin's "pilastro" (v. 8092) on the other hand is a column, like modern 'pilaster', a generally square-shaped column (DELI, 13th century). Here, it is engraved, according to the following lines, so a writing surface is needed. Neither B's form nor T's appear in RIALFrI as of this date (December 2021), and it is a hapax in this text. Since there is no mention of needing to open it or fight, we translate as "pillar."</note>

In both cases they are expressions of little value, and as PEB points out, "cenele" (T-L col. 109; Matsumura p. 518), 'fruit of the hawthorne' (f), or "cenelier" (m), 'hawthorne tree' appears in such constructions, so both lines are possibly a vocalized variant of that construction.

Yet they have just been chasing each other, so are they attacking each other? Making each other sick? Biting each other? All have been suggested. See the translation for the two possible interpretations in context. We thank colleagues Logan Whalen and Roberto Pesce in addition to PEB for consulting on this passage.

St. Eloy, or Eligius, was a great goldsmith and patron saint of artisans in metal, including goldsmiths. He was famous for having shod a horse possessed by the devil by removing the leg and restoring it once shod, and therefore is also the patron saint of veterinarians and in general, of horses and those who work with them. Historically, Eligius worked for 20 years to convert the pagan population of Flanders to Christianity, and is particularly honored in Flanders, in the province of Antwerp, and at Tournai, Kortrijk/Courtrai, Ghent, Bruges, and Douai. The French equivalent is Saint Eloi. See “Saint Eligius of Noyon“. CatholicSaints.Info. 10 February 2022. Web. 23 November 2022. https://catholicsaints.info/saint-eligius/. </note>

  Mainone (<hi rend="italic">Laut</hi>, p. 16), suggests that it is from the Greek κεραύνια (light bulb?); Scattolini: ceran. T-LF-I suggests "serran", an enclosed place; perhaps 'grove'? But again, there is no other example (in RIALFrI 'seran' is equivalent to: 'sera'; 'serena/o'; 'saranno'; 'serrando', no nouns other than 'sera', 'evening'). As Scattolini points out, there is no OF verb "peoner"; it is an adjective or substantive only (T-L cols. 690-691). However, "pedonare" appears in Old Italian; TLIO cites glosses on Boccaccio, 1375.</note>
<note target="#b9468" type="refer" resp="#LZM">9468] Cf. Dante, <hi rend="italic">Inf.</hi> 2.13; according to tradition, Aeneas had a son after his death, whom his wife bore in the woods, so named him "Silvius." Various Latin historians give "Aeneas Silvius" as the son of Silvius (Livy, <hi rend="italic">Ab urbe conditor</hi> 1.3; Dionysius of Helicarnassus, <hi rend="italic">Antiquitates romanae</hi> 1.71, Perseus); according to the same historians, his successor was Latinus Silvius. In any case, the descendants of the rulers of the Trojan settlement took the cognomen "Silvius" attached to personal names. Here then the "Silvian" seems to refer to the family line initiated by Aeneas's father, Anchises, whom Aeneas brought with him away from Troy. The father did not make it to the Italian peninsula. Scattolini notes that the reference is backwords and turned around, though referring to <hi rend="italic">Inf.</hi> (361 n641).</note>

 (<hi rend="italic">Lexikalische</hi>, p. 431). However, "robestre" the adjective also appears in F-I for "wild"; see the same page for Holtus, <hi rend="italic">EE</hi>. As an adjective, the <hi rend="italic">GdA</hi> defines it 'robusto' [strong/fierce]. For <hi rend="italic">fagon</hi>, <hi rend="italic">GdA</hi> gives "facion: .... fazione, l'insieme di schiere di soldati." Mainone is unclear as to the meaning; he notes that it is not French, and relates it to earlier appearances such as those mentioned, suggesting that all are based on the landscape feature (<hi rend="italic">GdA</hi>, 'côteau escarpé' [steep hillside], and but also notes the adjective "wild" [Fr. "rubeste," Ital "rubesto"; T-L rubeste, col. 1525], related earlier to rivers (<hi rend="italic">Laut</hi>, pp. 30-31). He then suggests that <hi rend="italic">fagon</hi> is like 'fango', 'mud' in the other versions. T-L defines "fouc" (with an unvoiced instead of a voiced consonant) as 'Schar' [crowd, host], but if that's the case, there is no element relating the word to the preceding one, so <hi rend="italic">robist</hi> might be an adjective deformed for rhyme.

The gate figure holds a book with black dots on it. "The figure on the tower will be Tholomé; what he is holding looks like an unbound book, or possibly a single sheet; possibly a map of the heavens; on the left side the half-circle showing may be part of a representation of the course of the stars; on the right the dots all round the edge of the page may represent stars in the center of which is something that looks like an astronomical instrument (part of an astrolabe?)"

Note that the tower is square, suggesting that <hi rend="italic">reont</hi> refers to something else. <hi rend="italic">Charere</hi> (line 9915) means both 'chair' (<hi rend="italic">cattedra</hi> in MSI) and 'highway' in this text, as confirmed by other F-I texts. In fact, the gateway is rounded and the human figure is at the highest point. Since this is a scholar with a book, it makes the most sense for him to be in a chair or seat. The portion remaining in the Turin MS (folio 146R) shows a loggia with rounded openings to the left of the illumination, with the three travellers outside to the left. One figure inside (with a fancy headdress) is on a chair with a baldacchino in a polygonal shape (not quite a circle, but circular) above. Since the walls in the Berlin MS illumination reach outside the frame, there is nothing above the figure who is on top of the gate there. It is unclear therefore whether the Turin version is a variation of meaning, but in any case, it is one possible explanation of <hi rend="italic">reont</hi>. </note>

However the gap is concealed here, while T reads 10161 vs. BP: Dize lo conte a Eneas chy lo mena. That truly demonstrates that the precedent of P sometimes follows the original more closely than the BT family" (p. 82, trans. LZM). Note that in Br this is a "carte de Iometrie" (v. 1113) followed directly by Huon's question to Aeneas, here v. 10005. Scattolini suggests that there seems to be an entire line missing following this one: this one is exactly parallel to the Br reading followed by "Llo bon conte U[gon] abraça et aplaine" which would obviate the need for presuming a blank in the middle of the following line ('The good count Huon embraced and caressed [aplanir] with his two arms Aeneas who led him'). But see the next line and note.</note>
 <note target="#b10004" type="codic" resp="#LZM">10004] The line is complete, but something is clearly missing for the sense here; cf.

Br similarly reads <hi rend="italic">Dist li quens Ugues ad Eneas qi lo maine</hi> (v. 1117). See note for preceding line. Scattolini suggests that a line is missing here, present in T; rather, it would seem that two lines are combined in B rather haphazardly, though it does almost make sense, and is 10 syllables. A verb for 'to say' seems to be missing.</note>

The meaning is a logical extension of 'to stay, remain' to 'to live, inhabit', which in fact seems to appear in several of the verb appearances (e.g., 4521, 5202, 8529, 5092, 4362, 7911, etc.). T 9703 poses a similar issue, with "demure." Matsumura's definition 'faire demore, faire séjour' (cf. T-L, col. 1382), resolves the difficulty, and so we translate.

 <note target="#b10335.1" type="interp" resp="#LZM">10335.1] This scene may refer to the beginning of the mass; at that era, the "introit involves the singing of a Psalm, which by this period would have been sung alternatingly by two choir bodies." It may be like improvisory practice where "one singer or group of singers would sing the original chant tune, and the other voices might improvise or sing composed counterpoint above it" and "vocal polyphony was used during mass, often with a low line carrying the chant tune, and upper voices providing countermelodies, improvised or otherwise." Where and when it was done and if the celebrant was involved would be difficult to verify since the specific origin of this story is not known. We thank Remi Chiu (Fine Arts (Music), LUM) his collaboration. We also thank Francesca Gambino (Filologia romanza, Dipartimento di Studi Linguistici e Letterari (DISSL), U. of Padova), who points out that "abis" as an adverb could reflect the verb "abesse" ("abaisser") in line 10333, "low(er)." "bis" in its modern sense first appears in the nineteenth century according to DEAF. See also P, vv. 4795-99.

"ras" (T-L rés, col. 977), meaning 'full, overflowing' might make sense if modifying the place, but not the people.

Looking elsewhere in the text we find "moit" (v. 7121) from "to move"; Matsumura lists "amovoir" but not reflexive form; T-L lists a possibly reflexive "movoir." If this were the case, it would signify "to gesticulate" as the text suggests already when he begs for pardon (v. 10730). The following tears and frequent expressions elsewhere about his dampening himself with tears make dampening seem more attractive as a possibility. An equivalent line is missing from Turin.

A missing abbreviation line (for the final word) and/or erroneous readings— of "s" for "f"– or a missing abbreviation– might be likely.

We propose emending the <hi rend="italic">s</hi> of <hi rend="italic">sor</hi> to <hi rend="italic">f</hi>; misreading these for each other is a frequent scribal error. Note that the following line is missing from Turin, so that MS tradition also had difficulty with these lines. If "pogie" is understood as missing an abbreviation mark for "porgie" (DELI porgere, attested 1250), the line might have a similar meaning to that of T [then he energetically/rapidly handed it to (others) so that they could see it].

Another alternative is that it might be derived from "ancone" : in T-L this is a banner with the Virgin Mary on it ( from Greek eikon); ançoner would be the banner-carrier, the leader (cf.

The three central minims look very similar, and either could be possible. Compare side-by-side with f. 56v (douiēt, v. 8091): the first two there are closely linked at the bottom of the stroke. This line is 9 syllables; T 11725: Se lor stano taly com esere doveano, where the construction is personal so there are more syllables (in addition to the more Italianate forms).

<note target="#b12198" type="interp" resp="#LZM">12198] It is unclear whom the poet might have in mind for reconquering the Empire from the Germans in 100 years (Turin gives 400 years). Villani's <hi rend="italic">Nuova Cronica</hi> (ed. Porta), which dates to the beginning of the fourteenth century, mentions various rulers named "Carlo Martello," and it is a recurring name in the Anjou family. The <hi rend="italic">Cronica</hi> notes that Charlemagne's family ceased ruling at the time of Ugo Ciapetta, Duca d'Orliensa. It also speaks of a Carlo Martello in the 1280's (pp. 200 ff), who, by his actions in the southern portion of the Italian peninsula and Sicily, seems to refer to the Charles Martel who lived 1271-95. The Anjou family in the peninsula in any case was very important, so either this reference or that of Turin may be linked to the French royal family in the peninsula at the time of the poem.
