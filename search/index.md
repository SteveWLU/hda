You can enter any word that appears in any of the four manuscript transcriptions, and all appearances of it will display by Manuscript shelf-mark with the line number. Upper and lower cases are not distinguished, and nor are accented characters from unaccented (*c*/*ç* fall together as do *e*, *é*, *è*).

### Options:

* “Whole” will give all words beginning with the chosen letters; for example, *hom* produces 460 results, including “homo” and “home”. If there are **no** words where that combination appears, there is no result; e.g., *inc* returns no results.
* “Starts with” will give all words starting with the chosen letters; for *hom*, 505 results, including “homelité”, “hombra” and “homezidio”, etc., in addition to “hom”, “home” and “homo”. Entering *inc* produces 72 results, including “inci”, “inclin”, “incegnor”, “inchina”, etc. This is therefore currently (July 2023) the only function that works exactly as advertised.
* “Ends with” gives every word with the chosen letters in it in the order given; so, for example, entering *hom* gives 527 results, including “T*hom*ais”,“C*hom*o” and “Jac*hom*o”. Entering inc gives 46 results, including “conv*inç*i”, “tr*inc*er”, “a*inc*h”, “l*inç*ie”, etc.
