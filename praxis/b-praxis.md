# Criteria of Edition for Berlin

## &#10081; 1. Introduction

## &#10081; 2. Capitalization

Capitalization is as in French: of nouns, not adjectives for origins; thus, _le g[ra]nt Françoi_ (v. 9042), but _la françoise gient_ (v. 11494). We capitalize names of places, names of people, but not titles unless part of a place name (e.g., _saint Laçaron_, v. 2232, but _Saint Pol_, v. 7953). Names of God and Mary are capitalized, as are the pronominalized attributes used for them (_Diex_; _Marie_; _Verge_; _Crucifis_; etc.), but not pronouns refering to them.

"v." designates a line number in order to  avoid confusion with the number one  that use of the English "l." could create (it looks too much like the number one), and "vv." stands for "lines."

## &#10081; 3. Punctuation in the MS

Periods appear at the end of most lines as well as before and after some names, rather inconsistently (e.g., Uliens., v. 10093; rois .agollāt., v. 10092). Similarly, numbers, here always Roman numerals (not Arabic), appear relatively consistently with periods around them: <br>
![alt text](/assets/images/mss/b-vii-punct.png)(v. 10238). These we have conventionalized through the text.

In the initial folios, there is a slash between the two hemistichs of each line (v. 338):

![alt_text](/assets/images/mss/b-hemistich-punct.png)

Consecutive usage of this slash stops at the end of 18Rb; 47Rb also contains lines with the divider as do occasional lines throughout the manuscript, with no evident plan (47Rb; 53Va; 62V- 63R; 72Ra; 73Vb; 84V).

There is usually a dot at the end of each line in the MS.

...] represents missing text in the MS; there are incomplete lines and missing lines between completed lines.

&lt; &gt; are used for interpolations, either our additions, suggestions from other editors, or information gleaned from other sources. These are all annotated.

We use conventional modern punctuation: commas, colons, semicolons, etc., with the addition of the raised dot (∙). This is used in two cases:

1. To designate the enclisis of an object pronoun initiating with vowel with a preceding pronoun (personal or relative), preposition or conjunction ending in a vowel so that the following pronoun begins with a consonant. Thus: _je∙l_ (v. 2631, 2812, etc.) or _ge∙l_ (v. 4271, etc.); _me∙l_ (v. 1537, etc.); _mi∙s_ (v. 8906); _ne∙l_ = negative + pronoun (v. 270, 472, etc.), _ne∙lle_ (v. 5530, 5573), _no∙l_ (v. 874, 8998); _qe∙l_ (v. 5527), _qi∙l_ (v. 2457), _que∙l_ (v. 9247, 11365), _qui∙l_ (v. 398, etc.); _si∙l_ (711, 2905, etc.) _te∙l_ (v. 6522, etc.); _ve∙l_ (v. 3844, etc.). For treatment of definite articles, see "word division."

2. To designate syntactic doubling or assimilation, written or not. In Italian usage, editors have generally used or recommended that convention with certain variations; Brambilla-Ageno recommends the raised dot for syntactic doubling (127), offering examples from Contini's _Poeti del Duecento_: "_né inn∙altra vista_", "_n'e nonn∙attende [...]_"; Furlati writes _a∙rre, que∙rre_, and uses a dash for "assimilation at a distance" like _nnol-mel, a llor-ver dire_. Donadello, in his edition of the _Tristano Veneto_, also uses the raised dot for syntactic doubling: _a∙ssi, che∙sse_, etc. (38). Similarly Allaire in her edition of the _Tristano Panciatichiano_, _e∙lla, per∙ll_, etc., but using a space alone for assimilation of the negative: _no si, no gli_, etc. (9). We therefore, given the nature of this text, use the raised dot also for assimilations, whether expressed by a doubled consonant or not: _a∙nos_ (6443, "with us"); _a∙sspirç_ (7744, "to the spirits"), etc. Standard usage of the preposition plus article, as in "del" and similar standard Old French usage of "es" dictates one word for those and similar usages.

## &#10081; 4. Abbreviations

        Berlin uses both a wide variety and frequent abbreviations, in comparison with, for example, the _Roland_ V4 (Beretta xxiii-xxvii) or Aliscans (Holtus xxiii-xxiv). The frequency may be partially due to a difference in text length, but is also in general usage, with the result that the number of abbreviations in B's version of Huon is very large.

    		We follow the most frequent fully-expanded form found in the text where possible; where there is none (e.g. _parjurer_ and its forms) we follow either the rhyme, if the word in question is in rhyme position; or the authoritative dictionary in the field if not it is not (Tobler-Lommatzsch [TL] for Old French; the _Tesoro della lingua italiana delle origini_ [TLIO] for Italian or _Dizionario etimologico italiano_ [DELI], where the example is before or contemporary with our text, 1341; the _Glossarium mediae et infimae latinitatis_ [DuCange] for Latin). The asterisk (*) stands for "in rhyme position." There are a total of 12,317 expanded abbreviations in the text, and ten hiatuses where text is missing.

    		Wherever the abbreviation creates a double letter, the abbreviation is written first.

    		We give examples of appearances of  the resolution with the line number of its appearance, and where there is a possible issue, we give the full form for comparison. Italics in the edition itself are used for the expansions of abbreviations; here, italics with square brackets [ ] represent the expanded word from the text with the expansion in the brackets. For the MS form, we attempt to reproduce typographically the actual appearance where possible, and otherwise provide a copy of an actual appearance from the MS. Since the transcription is available to all, we do not give specific line numbers unless necessary.

Therefore the one time that the abbreviation appears alone as a preposition, we expand as _[con]_ (v. 2516) and the one time it appears alone as a conjunction we expand as _[com]_ (v. 2280). When the abbreviation is used within a word, in general we expand _[con]_, e.g., _[con]q[ui]st_, v. 49, but before vowels and the labials b and p we expand as _[com]_, following the usage of the text; e.g., _co[m]bate_, v. 1099; _[com]peigno[n]s_, v. 78 (example, above).</td>

              <tr>
                <td>The abbreviations of <b>p</b> are problematic due to the differences in development of French and Italian area dialects. Two abbreviations are very specific and not problematic, but the <b>p</b> with a cross-stroke over the descender can designate three possible resolutions. In that case, we separate longer words from the abbreviation alone. Most specific words or expressions can follow the most frequent appearances, but the prepositions _par_, _per_, _por_ when alone pose a challenge. _par_ appears 206 times; _per_ 53, and _por_ 733. However, they have different meanings, these are not just prepositions. _par_ is also from the verb "to appear," and furthermore functions as an adverbial intensifier. _per_ means "father" (42 times), "jewel" (2 times), "stone" (two times), "peer (of the realm)" (1 time), "equal" (twice) and "Peter" (once), and is the preposition only 11 times. Furthermore, the abbreviation of a letter (_i_ or _r_) above the letter appears with <b>p</b>.<br>

              Where p with the abbreviation of a slash on the descender appears alone without other indications the resolution is decided as follows:

              <ol
                <li if there are other expressions with the preposition, it follows the majority of those (e.g., _par force_ (7 appearances) v. _por force_ (2 appearances) ==> _p[ar] force_;</li>
                <li in parallel expressions, where one is the full form, the other follows: e.g., _ᵱ mons [et] por vaus [et] ᵱ ces poi agu_ (v. 4985) ==> _p[er] mons [et] por vaus [et] p[or] ces poi agu_;</li>
                <li where there is an equal number of expressions, the resolution is _p[or]_ since that is by far the most frequent (e.g., _par vos_, 8 appearances; _por vos_, 8 appearances, the 9 abbreviations are resolved _p[or] vos_).</li>
                <li where there are no similar expressions or other means to judge, the resolution is _p[or]_ given its predominance.</li>
              </ol>

              <h4 գ</h4>

              The abbreviations of _q_ are also problematic. There are again three possible abbreviations: _q_ with a letter (like an _i_) above; _q_ with the titulus above; and _q_ with a cross-stroke on the descender. _q_ with a cross-stroke appears 28 times and resolved _q[ui]_, as demonstrated by other full forms in the text: _[con]q[ui]st_, _[con]q[ui]s_, _q[ui]e[r]t_ (2 appearances), _sorq[ui]die_, _q[ui]er_, _q[ui]_ (8 appearances), _plaq[ui]ment_ (2 appearances), _req[ui]e[r]_, _delinq[ui]re_, _req[ui]s_, _q[ui]d_, _req[ui]rois_, _q[ui]er_, _[con]q[ui]sons_, _tranq[ui]limant_, _req[ui]e[r]_, _nasq[ui]_, _q[ui]sm req[ui]er_. References to TL or DELI or both clarify specific uses within words or expressions.

              However, since the palatalization in the two language areas proceeded differently, _qu-_ represents a variety of different phonemes and no standard existed at the time. Is it the same as _q-_ alone? Thus in some cases we must decide how to establish use: within an individual lexical family? within a certain part of speech (e.g., demonstratives)? should we create a regularity when none existed at the time or in the text? For example, final _–que_ alternates with _–qe_, _–c_ and _–che_. I have chosen for now to standardize in _–qu-_ in part because it makes reading easier, and follows modern French usage in spelling with _q-_. Then the question of the final vowel: _-e_ or _–i_? Each has a specific meaning in the modern languages. In the original text, there are 89 forms _q_ alone; 494 of _qe_; 137 of _qi_; 472 of _qu_; 1089 of _que_; 687 of _qui_ (though there are also some questions of word division involved for conjunctions; more about this below). The more frequent form by far is therefore _que_, but that might be expected as being the object case (for which there are many more possibilities than the subject case: direct object, object of preposition, etc.) and an interrogative form. Because of the difficulty of metrics in a Franco-Italian text, I have not in general elided _u_ before vowels, with the exceptions noted below.

              <div class="abbr-examples">![alt_text]("b-qi-abbr.png", alt: "b-qi-abbr.png") %> (v. 21) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;![alt_text]("b-qst.abbr.png", alt: "b-qst.abbr.png") %> (v. 49) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;![alt_text]("b-qaua-abbr.png", alt: "b-qaua-abbr.png") %> (v. 363)</div>

              The second (_q_ with a slash on the descender) appears 28 times and is always resolved _q[ui]_, as attested by other forms of the same words in complete form for the most part, with 8 of those _qui_ alone. The first (_q_ with _i_ above the line) appears 17 times and is resolved in _q[ui]_ when subject. _q[ui]_ alone can represent relative pronouns as subject ("who"); demonstrative pronouns (since _qui_ also stands for the palatalized Modern Italian _quelli_, MSF _ceux_); the interrogative for a person; and the proverbial pronoun "he/she who." Other abbreviated forms—relative pronoun direct object, the conjunction, an interrogative for a thing or fact—are resolved _q[ue]_. Where the _u_ is already present and the q bears an abbreviation, the final vowel follows the same rule. This means that 523 _q_ with a dot or similar designation above were expanded as _q[ue]_ in addition to those surmounted by an _i_. In Old French itself usage was not regular; Ménard notes that dialectal usage varied and is explicable.<!-- FN: Philippe Ménard, Manuel du français du moyen âge, 1. syntaxe de l'ancien français (Sobodi, 1973), ¶64, "Remarques," p. 80. -->

              While the _Conseils_ counsels that letters written above the line should not be considered restituted, i.e., should not be written as abbreviations (Fasc. 1, p. 31), certain of these are in fact abbreviations; that is, they represent more than one letter. Corrections and insertions are frequently marked by a caret below the line for placement of the insertion above the line or in the margin. The use of above-the-line abbreviations of one letter is frequent in this manuscript, and as such is remarkable and worthy of note. Therefore in the electronic version, these are visible: the letter above the line is in parentheses (as are standard additions above the line) and the expanded letters are in italics as are other abbreviations. In a final view, it will be possible for the reader to see the text without these parentheses. For this reason we have avoided parentheses in our edition so as to facilitate programming the final version.

              The combinations in question are:

              <b>e above the line, i above the line, o above the line, r above the line</b>

              The forms that use them are as follows:

              <dt>Numbers</dt>
                  <dd>In Berlin, larger numbers are written in Roman numerals (there are no Arabic numbers) and usually between dots (though this is not entirely consistent). We reproduce these in small roman numerals. However, larger numbers are sometimes surmounted by a "c" or an "m".  These we reproduce as superscripts of the roman numeral to facilitate reading: ![alt_text]("b-.x.-abbr.png", alt: "b-qnt-abbr.png") %> .x. with an m above, v. 9334).  In one case we find "or" after "iiii," clearly a representation of the Latin "quattuor" ![alt_text]("b-.iiii.-abbr.png", alt: "b-qnt-abbr.png") %> (v. 76).</dd>

  ## &#10081; 5. Separation of words


        We follow standard practice for separation of words in early texts. The separation of words in the MS is varying and not always logical.

              <ul
                <li We join _–ment/-mant_ to the adjective for adverbs.</li>
                <li Three times, numbers larger than 100 appear written out: 186, 6536 and 11668. These we write in two words, as is the French usage, not the Italian (<emtroi cent; cincque cent_).</li>
                <li Conjunctions and prepositions are more complicated matters, since editors tend to use the conventions for the language of edition, viz., French or Italian, which differ: _ fin que_ vx. _finché, por que _ vs. _perché_, for example. In keeping with the nearness to Old French, we follow French conventions here. Thus _jusque_ and its variants are one word (_jusq'a; jusque; jusqe; jusq[ue]_). We write out the form in its entirety even before a vowel, since syllable count is problematic. Similarly, _trosque (trosch'a, trosqe, trosq[ue]_). Other forms, however, are written separately (numbers in parentheses are line numbers of the poem).
                <ul>
                <li>_ainç che_ (3999)</li>
                <li>_anch che_ (7533)</li>
                <li>_enfraci que_ (1155); _enfraci q[ue]_ (4470, 6560)</li>
                <li>_fin che_ (2148); _fin q'_ (4466); _fin que_ (4696); _fin q[ue]_ (7986); _fin qe_ (1947)</li>
                <li>_for ch'_ (5328), _fors che_ (4920); _fors qe_ (2819)</li>
                <li>_fraci que_ (2053, 9966) cf. _enfraci que_</li>
                <li>_ni anch_ (1041, 1453): _ni_ = "or" in a negative sense; Ital. _neanche_ is not attested until 1686 acc. to DELI ("assolutamente no, in nessun caso [...]") although this seems to be the meaning in line 1041.</li>
                <li>_por choi_ (5156); _por qoi_ (5235, 5684); _por qoy_ (5623, 8719); _po[r] qoy_ (5357); por quoy (879, 2216, 3414, 7730, 10166); _po[r] quoy_ (10990). Some editors use one word, others two; the editor of _Aquilon de Bavière_ (Wunderli) uses _porcoi_ as does Limentani in _Estoires de Venise_ (Martino da Canale). Both are prose; _Aquilon_ is dated late fourteenth-early fifteenth century; _Estoires_ second half of the thirteenth century. The editors of the _Entrée d'Espagne_ (Thomas), editors of the _Continuazione dell'Entrée_ (Di Ninni) and _Guerra d'Attila_ (Stendardo), on the other hand, give _por qoy, por quei/par qoi_, etc. The _Entrée_  and _Continuazione_ date to the first half of the fourteenth and the _Guerra_ to mid-fourteenth. The differences are also of genre. Therefore we have kept the two as separate lexemes.</li>
                <li>_pois qe_ (1324, 1340, 1911, 8382); _pois que_ (8465, 8531, 10345); _pois qui_ (8078); _poiq qu'_ (2549, 10411, 12045)</li>
                <li>_puis che_ (4842); _puis que_ (9785, 9795)</li>
                <li>_pur che_ (4741); _pur que_ (727); _pur qe_ (8084)</li>
                <li>_selong ch'_ (5199); _selonch che_ (2218, 4725)</li>
                <li>_si che_ (11042); _si qe_ (1845, 5549; 5901); _si que_ (11770; 12152)</li>
              </ul>

                <li Adverbs, together with prepositions, are another element of possible difficulty. Again we follow French convention for those that exist in French, so for example, _aval, amont; deci, dela, deprés, desoz/desoç_. Certain forms are particularly found in rhyme.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>dela, for example, 16 of  22 appearances where it means "over there." This is not "from there," which would be two words: in v. 5206, on the other hand, "from there," is distinguished in two words. In some cases, it could mean either, and thus we have left it in two words: 7192 ("he saw clearly that he could do nothing over there" OR "from there he saw clearly he could do nothing").</li>
                    <li>deça as preposition or adverb appears 15 times (one appearance is a form of "devoir"): three times in rhyme, four times as par deça (one of those in rhyme) and five times in contrast with dela; only four are not in those sort of formulaic positions. Similarly, deza appears once with dela and once in rhyme.</li>
                    <li>deci is much more complicated: it means "until" in its various combinations, whereas in our text it usually means "from here" as in "get out of here" when it appears alone. We thus keep all the combinations documented in T-L (deci que, deci en, etc.) making seven appearances; the others (de ci) are the equivalent of "d'ici," for 14 appearances.</li>
                    <li>desor is also deceptive since des or (16 appearances), des ore (1 appearance) has a totally different meaning ("from now on" vs. "above" or "on top (of)"), which is much more frequent (57 appearances). There are a few cases in which either could be the form, and these are marked in the notes. Des or(e) mes is also written as three words, following OF (4 appearances).</li>
                    <li>desoz/desoç appear respectively 1 and 7 times.</li>
                    <li>aval(s) appears 12 times total: as a val once (in a combination, v. Non sta d'aler a val, a plagne [et] poy; otherwise it is either contrasted with amon(t) clearly (4 times) or acts as an adverb juxtaposed to the main verb (1 time).</li>
                    <li>amon(t) appears nine times total: four times with aval(s), otherwise alone, always as an adverb.</li>
                    <li>tutor, totore, etc. are written in one word, like _tuttora_, Old Italian; cf. Treccani, _Enciclopedia Dantesca_); similarly for _tothore_ (< from Lat. HORA(M)). _enfra_ is the Italian, not the French _enfre(s)ci a_ (TL); cf. other Franco-Italian texts like the Entrée d'Espagne; Geste Francor; Guerra d'Attila, Bovo d'Antona Laurenziana; cf. also infra, also found in _Estoires de Venise_ and _Aquilon de Baviere_.</li>
                </ul>
                <li Some expressions in their multiplicity require one decision because of the spelling in this MS; for example, _or endroit_ (12 appearances), which here we represent always as two words since it also appears as _ore endroit_ (1 appearance, v. 11055); the choice lies between emending one form or writing all as two words. Since they are written as two words in the MS, we use two words. Editors have varied in their treatment of this form.</li>
                <li Common to Franco-Italian texts is the problem of the prosthetic e- before s + consonant: [Discussion to follow.]</li>
                <li Other prefixes are more problematic, most especially a-. [Discussion to follow.]</li>
                </ul>

Punctuation.
In editing the text, strong differences became clear between US practices and those elsewhere. Since the project is funded by the US government and the Primary Investigators are American, their practices form the basis of the punctuation. That usage is informed by editing practice in both France and Italy for older texts. The following is a list of differences that we have found in consulting. We hope it will assist our continental colleagues in understanding our choices.
• We have used US style quotes: double for primary speaker, single for quote within a quote. Quotes are normally announced by a comma; we have acceded to French tradition by using a comma within a line and a colon at the end of a line of verse.
• Punctuation is within the quote marks, so a period is before the close quote. This is US format, which differs both from non-US English and from European usage.

E.g.,   Huon said, "....Prester John said, '...'."

• There is no punctuation  (comma, colon or quote) when "that" precedes an indirect quote.

    Huon said that he wanted to continue.

• In a list, when individual items include details, we use a semicolon to allow commas within the list:

Ynide accompanied Huon, her husband; Berart, Huon's cousin; Baudoin and Thomas, her brothers; and two hundred of Huon's men, to Paris.

• In US English we use quotes "" to designate titles of articles and names of people. In French they use italics. Thus the titles of psalms are in bold, because italics instead show the resolution of abbreviations (not required in French editions: Conseils 1, 31).
