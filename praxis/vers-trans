        ❡ 1. Introduction 
        For the Berlin Huon d'Auvergne, punctuation and citations are
          according to the general norms outlined in the overall document. However, the Berlin Huon
          d'Auvergne is very close to Old French. For that reason we keep close to the most
          respected norms for Old French editions. There are situations in which Old French norms do
          not work with the Franco-Italian text, so these are made explicit in the following
          list.
      

      
      
      
        ❡ 2. Capitalization
        Capitalization is as in French: of nouns, not adjectives for origins; thus, le g[ra]nt
          Françoi (v. 9042), but la françoise gient (v. 11494). We capitalize names of places,
          names of people, but not titles unless part of a place name (e.g., saint Laçaron, v.
          2232, but Saint Pol, v. 7953). Names of God and Mary are capitalized, as are the
          pronominalized attributes used for them (Diex; Marie; Verge; Crucifis; etc.), but
          not pronouns refering to them.
        "v." designates a line number in order to avoid confusion with the number one that use of
          the English "l." could create (it looks too much like the number one), and "vv." stands
          for "lines."
      

      
      
      
        ❡ 3. Punctuation
        Periods appear at the end of most lines as well as before and after some names, rather
          inconsistently (e.g., Uliens., v. 10093; rois .agollāt., v. 10092). Similarly, numbers,
          here always Roman numerals (not Arabic), appear relatively consistently with periods
          around them:

        
          
        

        These we have conventionalized through the text.

        In the initial folios, there is a slash between the two hemistichs of each line (v.
          338).

        
          
        

        Consecutive usage of this slash stops at the end of 18Rb; 47Rb also contains lines with
          the divider as do occasional lines throughout the manuscript, with no evident plan (47Rb;
          53Va; 62V- 63R; 72Ra; 73Vb; 84V).

        There is usually a dot at the end of each line in the MS.

        [...] : Three points in square brackets represents missing text in the MS; there are
          incomplete lines and missing lines between completed lines.

        &lt; &gt; are used for interpolations, either our additions, suggestions from other
          editors, or information gleaned from other sources. These are all annotated.

        We use conventional modern punctuation: commas, colons, semicolons, etc., with the
          addition of the raised dot (∙). This is used in two cases:

        
          To designate the enclisis of an object pronoun initiating with vowel with a
            preceding pronoun (personal or relative), preposition or conjunction ending in a vowel
            so that the following pronoun begins with a consonant. Thus: je∙l (v. 2631, 2812,
            etc.) or ge∙l (v. 4271, etc.); me∙l (v. 1537, etc.); mi∙s (v. 8906); ne∙l =
            negative + pronoun (v. 270, 472, etc.), ne∙lle (v. 5530, 5573), no∙l (v. 874, 8998);
            qe∙l (v. 5527), qi∙l (v. 2457), que∙l (v. 9247, 11365), qui∙l (v. 398, etc.);
            si∙l (711, 2905, etc.) te∙l (v. 6522, etc.); ve∙l (v. 3844, etc.). For treatment
            of definite articles, see "word division."

        ❡ 4. Abbreviations
        Berlin uses both a wide variety and frequent abbreviations, in comparison with, for
          example, the Roland V4 (Beretta xxiii-xxvii) or Aliscans (Holtus xxiii-xxiv). The
          frequency may be partially due to a difference in text length, but is also in general
          usage, with the result that the number of abbreviations in B's version of Huon is very
          large.
        We follow the most frequent fully-expanded form found in the text where possible; where
          there is none (e.g. parjurer and its forms) we follow either the rhyme, if the word in
          question is in rhyme position; or the authoritative dictionary in the field if not it is
          not (Tobler-Lommatzsch [TL] for Old French; the Tesoro della lingua italiana delle
          origini [TLIO] for Italian or Dizionario etimologico italiano [DELI], where the example
          is before or contemporary with our text, 1341; the Glossarium mediae et infimae
          latinitatis [DuCange] for Latin). The asterisk (*) stands for "in rhyme position." There
          are a total of 12,317 expanded abbreviations in the text, and ten hiatuses where text is
          missing.
        Wherever the abbreviation creates a double letter, the abbreviation is written first.
        We give examples of appearances of the resolution with the line number of its appearance,
          and where there is a possible issue, we give the full form for comparison. Italics in the
          edition itself are used for the expansions of abbreviations; here, italics with square
          brackets [ ] represent the expanded word from the text with the expansion in the brackets.
          For the MS form, we attempt to reproduce typographically the actual appearance where
          possible, and otherwise provide a copy of an actual appearance from the MS. Since the
          transcription is available to all, we do not give specific line numbers unless
          necessary.

              Wunderli) and use [et].

        4.4. Abbreviations with 'con' / 'com'
        
          
          
        
        
          
            [con] or [com]
            con appears 6 times alone; two of these are for "conte," referring to Huon (v.
              641, 3491); one is for the conjunction "comme" (v. 708); the other three are "with"
              com appears 175 times as an adverb and a conjunction. Therefore the one time that
              the abbreviation appears alone as a preposition, we expand as [con] (v. 2516) and
              the one time it appears alone as a conjunction we expand as [com] (v. 2280). When
              the abbreviation is used within a word, in general we expand [con], e.g.,
              [con]q[ui]st, v. 49, but before vowels and the labials b and p we expand as [com],
              following the usage of the text; e.g., co[m]bate, v. 1099; [com]peigno[n]s, v. 78
              (example, above). 
          
        
      

      
      
        4.5. dne with a dot above between the n and e (7 appearances)
        
          
            D[omi]ne, from Latin, similarly D[omi]n[u]m; cf. v. 6063 with the full form
              and v. 3318, Domi[n]e 
          
        
      

      
      
        4.6. titulus (long line above vowel)
        
          
            [en]
            ente[n]dim[en]t, co[n]v[en]t, etc., both in rhyme; Devotem[en]t, not in
              rhyme.
          
          
            [m]
            before labials: e.g., aco[m]plir; fla[m]be, but not across word boundaries:
              e.g., i[n] parolle, though the MS itself does not follow that rule at times, e.g.,
              Em p[ar]durable (v. 9790). Exception: no[n]portant (cf. v. 6082, where the non
              seems to be felt still in its complete form). cu[m], co[m] for adverb or
              conjunction (MSI come, MSF comme); cum full form, 254 appearances; com full form,
              75 appearances; cu[m] 220 appearances, co[m] 2 appearances. This was a surprising
              situation: con, for the preposition "with," appears only 3 times. Com also
              functions as a preposition, so the 56 times cū functions as a preposition, it must
              be resolved cu[m]; cō, however, can be resolved as co[n] (one time, v.
              5804).
          
          
            [m]
            for Latin finals: s[er]vu[m], v. 6938
          
          
            [n]
            no[n], co[n], cu[n] (con, full form for "with," 3 appearances, as
              preposition—see above); where doubled, the abbreviated [n] or [m] is written first,
              e.g., enco[m]me[n]ce; in cases where the two different, we follow modern convention:
              e.g., om[n]ipote[n]t 
          
          
            [omi]
            d[omi]ne in Latin quotes, e.g., v. 8443
          
          
            [on]
            s[on]t, v. 888; n[on] (non, 688 appearances; nen, 15 appearances)
          
          
            [u]
            to[u]t (perhaps from copyist error reading 'n'?) v. 1086
          
        
      

      
      
        4.7. titulus (long line above vowel)
        
          
            [st]
            ē: e[st] (70 times; cf. Holtus, Aliscans, where this appears 63 times, p.
              XXIII; e.g., here v. 10305)
          
          
            [est]
            pōes: po[est]és (v. 10305)
          
          
            [s]
            nō: no[s] (v. 5748)
          
        
      

      
      
        4.8. The abbreviation 'nre'
        
          
          
        
        
          
            n[ost]re
            (6 appearances; 18 nostre, 10 notre, 4 notra when unabbreviated)
          
        
      

      
      
        4.9. There are three abbreviations with the letter p plus the
          standard abbreviation for "r" plus vowel.
        
          
            ᵱ
            The abbreviations of p are problematic due to the differences in development of
              French and Italian area dialects. Two abbreviations are very specific and not
              problematic, but the p with a cross-stroke over the descender can designate three
              possible resolutions. In that case, we separate longer words from the abbreviation
              alone. Most specific words or expressions can follow the most frequent appearances,
              but the prepositions par, per, por when alone pose a challenge. par appears
              206 times; per 53, and por 733. However, they have different meanings, these are
              not just prepositions. par is also from the verb "to appear," and furthermore
              functions as an adverbial intensifier. per means "father" (42 times), "jewel" (2
              times), "stone" (two times), "peer (of the realm)" (1 time), "equal" (twice) and
              "Peter" (once), and is the preposition only 11 times. Furthermore, the abbreviation of
              a letter (i or r) above the letter appears with p. --When an abbreviation with p
              appears within a lexical item, it follows the other words of the family where these
              exist; if not, the listed lemma of TL or DELI (as appropriate to the form).
          
          
            [ar]
            p[ar]don 3 unabbreviated forms with pardon, none with perdon, so all
              resolved to p[ar]don; ap[ar]tient (there are no full forms, but 7 abbreviated

        Where p with the abbreviation of a slash on the descender appears alone without other
          indications the resolution is decided as follows.
        
          if there are other expressions with the preposition, it follows the majority of
            those (e.g., par force (7 appearances) v. por force (2 appearances) ==&gt; p[ar]
            force;
          &gt;in parallel expressions, where one is the full form, the other follows: e.g., ᵱ
            mons [et] por vaus [et] ᵱ ces poi agu (v. 4985) ==&gt; p[er] mons [et] por vaus [et]
            p[or] ces poi agu;
          where there is an equal number of expressions, the resolution is p[or] since that
            is by far the most frequent (e.g., par vos, 8 appearances; por vos, 8 appearances,
            the 9 abbreviations are resolved p[or] vos).
          &gt;where there are no similar expressions or other means to judge, the resolution is
            p[or] given its predominance.
        
      

      
      
        4.14. Abbreviations with 'q'
        The abbreviations of q are also problematic. There are again three possible
          abbreviations: q with a letter (like an i) above; q with the titulus above; and q
          with a cross-stroke on the descender. q with a cross-stroke appears 28 times and
          resolved q[ui], as demonstrated by other full forms in the text: [con]q[ui]st,
          [con]q[ui]s, q[ui]e[r]t (2 appearances), sorq[ui]die, q[ui]er, q[ui] (8
          appearances), plaq[ui]ment (2 appearances), req[ui]e[r], delinq[ui]re, req[ui]s,
          q[ui]d, req[ui]rois, q[ui]er, [con]q[ui]sons, tranq[ui]limant, req[ui]e[r],
          nasq[ui], q[ui]sm req[ui]er. References to TL or DELI or both clarify specific uses
          within words or expressions.
        However, since the palatalization in the two language areas proceeded differently, qu-
          represents a variety of different phonemes and no standard existed at the time. Is it the
          same as q- alone? Thus in some cases we must decide how to establish use: within an
          individual lexical family? within a certain part of speech (e.g., demonstratives)? should
          we create a regularity when none existed at the time or in the text? For example, final
          –que alternates with –qe, –c and –che. I have chosen for now to standardize in
          –qu- in part because it makes reading easier, and follows modern French usage in
          spelling with q-. Then the question of the final vowel: -e or –i? Each has a
          specific meaning in the modern languages. In the original text, there are 89 forms q
          alone; 494 of qe; 137 of qi; 472 of qu; 1089 of que; 687 of qui (though there
          are also some questions of word division involved for conjunctions; more about this
          below). The more frequent form by far is therefore que, but that might be expected as
          being the object case (for which there are many more possibilities than the subject case:
          direct object, object of preposition, etc.) and an interrogative form. Because of the
          difficulty of metrics in a Franco-Italian text, I have not in general elided u before
          vowels, with the exceptions noted below.
        
          
          
          
        
        The second (q with a slash on the descender) appears 28 times and is always resolved
          q[ui], as attested by other forms of the same words in complete form for the most part,
          with 8 of those qui alone. The first (q with i above the line) appears 17 times and
          is resolved in q[ui] when subject. q[ui] alone can represent relative pronouns as
          subject ("who"); demonstrative pronouns (since qui also stands for the palatalized
          Modern Italian quelli, MSF ceux); the interrogative for a person; and the proverbial
          pronoun "he/she who." Other abbreviated forms—relative pronoun direct object, the
          conjunction, an interrogative for a thing or fact—are resolved q[ue]. Where the u is
          already present and the q bears an abbreviation, the final vowel follows the same rule.
          This means that 523 q with a dot or similar designation above were expanded as q[ue]
          in addition to those surmounted by an i. In Old French itself usage was not regular;
          Ménard notes that dialectal usage varied and is explicable.

          certain of these are in fact abbreviations; that is, they represent more than one letter.
          Corrections and insertions arhi rend="italics"e frequently marked by a caret below the line for placement
          of the insertion above the line or in the margin. The use of above-the-line abbreviations
          of one letter is frequent in this manuscript, and as such is remarkable and worthy of
          note. Therefore in the electronic version, these are visible: the letter above the line is
          in parentheses (as are standard additions above the line) and the expanded letters are in
          italics as are other abbreviations. In a final view, it will be possible for the reader to
          see the text without these parentheses. For this reason we have avoided parentheses in our
          edition so as to facilitate programming the final version.
        The combinations in question are: e above the line, i above the line, o above the line, r
          above the line. The forms that use them are as follows.

        4.30. Special characters
        
          Three particular characters are present in this MS
          
            
              Final "z" shape
              This character represents m and is drawn out into a "z" shape at the end of the
                word. written as m with footnote (v. 5150) ; cf. Conseils fasc. I p. 28, #
                11.
            
            
              Final ӡ
              The character ӡ at the end of a word represents [ue]. Examples: arciveʃqӡ for
                arcivesq[ue] (19 plus possibly 1 erased; arcivesqe 7 appearances; arcivesch 1,
                arcivesche 1); ci[n]cqӡ (once, v. 11668); jusq[ue] and its combinations (57,
                all with final ӡ; jusque, jusqe 2 appearances each); adonqӡ for adonq[ue]
                (2); donqӡ (7); fraciqӡ (2); enfraciqӡ (1); auqӡ (1); aveqӡ (1);
                tr/[r]osq[ue], trosq[ue]mant (18 total appearances; trosch 3 appearances;
                trosqe 4 appearances; trosque 1 appearance); vesq[ue] (3 appearances; vesque
                2 appearances; vesqe 8 appearances; vesque 2; vesch/e twice also). There is
                one odd case with two abbreviations for the same thing: auqӡ that also has the
                line above the q (l. 3323). 
            
            
              Final j
              The final j at the end of Roman numerals stands for "one"; this is transcribed
                as "i" (Conseils 5a, p. 24).
            
          
        
      

      
      
        4.31. Numbers
        In Berlin, larger numbers are written in Roman numerals (there are no Arabic numbers) and
          usually between dots (though this is not entirely consistent). We reproduce these in small
          roman numerals. However, larger numbers are sometimes surmounted by a "c" or an "m". These
          we reproduce as superscripts of the roman numeral to facilitate reading (.x. with an m
          above, v. 9334). In one case we find "or" after "iiii," clearly a representation of the
          Latin "quattuor" (v. 76).
        
          
          
        
      

      
      
      
        
          ❡ 5. Separation of Words
          We follow standard practice for separation of words in early texts. The separation of
            words in the MS is varying and not always logical.
        

        
          The letter r above the line --&gt; vowel+r or r+vowel (ur, re, ri,
            er)
          
            We join –ment/-mant to the adjective for adverbs.
            Three times, numbers larger than 100 appear written out: 186, 6536 and 11668.
              These we write in two words, as is the French usage, not the Italian (&lt; emtroi
              cent; cincque cent).
            Conjunctions and prepositions are more complicated matters, since editors tend to
              use the conventions for the language of edition, viz., French or Italian, which
              differ:  fin que vx. finché, por que vs. perché, for example. In keeping with
              the nearness to Old French, we follow French conventions here. Thus jusque and its
              variants are one word (jusq'a; jusque; jusqehi rend="italics"; jusq[ue]). We write out the form in
              its entirety even before a vowel, since syllable count is problematic. Similarly,
              trosque (trosch'a, trosqe, trosq[ue]). Other forms, however, are written separately
              (numbers in parentheses are line numbers of the poem).
          
        

        
          Examples:
          
            ainç che (3999)
            anch che (7533)
            enfraci que (1155); enfraci q[ue] (4470, 6560)
            fin che (2148); fin q' (4466); fin que (4696); fin q[ue] (7986); fin qe
              (1947)
            for ch' (5328), fors che (4920); fors qe (2819)
            fraci que (2053, 9966) cf. enfraci que
            ni anch (1041, 1453): ni = "or" in a negative sense; Ital. neanche is not
              attested until 1686 acc. to DELI ("assolutamente no, in nessun caso [...]") although
              this seems to be the meaning in line 1041.
            por choi (5156); por qoi (5235, 5684); por qoy (5623, 8719); po[r] qoy
              (5357); por quoy (879, 2216, 3414, 7730, 10166); po[r] quoy (10990). Some editors
              use one word, others two; the editor of Aquilon de Bavière (Wunderli) uses porcoi
              as does Limentani in Estoires de Venise (Martino da Canale). Both are prose;
              Aquilon is dated late fourteenth-early fifteenth century; Estoires second half of
              the thirteenth century. The editors of the Entrée d'Espagne (Thomas), editors of the
              Continuazione dell'Entrée (Di Ninni) and Guerra d'Attila (Stendardo), on the other
              hand, give por qoy, por quei/par qoi, etc. The Entrée and Continuazione date to
              the first half of the fourteenth and the Guerra to mid-fourteenth. The differences
              are also of genre. Therefore we have kept the two as separate lexemes.
            pois qe (1324, 1340, 1911, 8382); pois que (8465, 8531, 10345); pois qui
              (8078); poiq qu' (2549, 10411, 12045)
            puis che (4842); puis que (9785, 9795)
            pur che (4741); pur que (727); pur qe (8084)
            selong ch' (5199); selonch che (2218, 4725)
            si che (11042); si qe (1845, 5549; 5901); si que (11770; 12152)
          
        
        
          Separation of adverbs
          Adverbs, together with prepositions, are another element of possible difficulty. Again
            we follow French convention for those that exist in French, so for example, aval,
            amont; deci, dela, deprés, desoz/desoç. Certain forms are particularly found in
            rhyme.
          
            dela, for example, 16 of 22 appearances where it means "over there." This is not
              "from there," which would be two words: in v. 5206, on the other hand, "from there,"
              is distinguished in two words. In some cases, it could mean either, and thus we have
              left it in two words: 7192 ("he saw clearly that he could do nothing over there" OR
              "from there he saw clearly he could do nothing").
            deça as preposition or adverb appears 15 times (one appearance is a form of
              "devoir"): three times in rhyme, four times as par deça (one of those in rhyme) and
              five times in contrast with dela; only four are not in those sort of formulaic
              positions. Similarly, deza appears once with dela and once in rhyme.
            deci is much more complicated: it means "until" in its various combinations,
              whereas in our text it usually means "from here" as in "get out of here" when it
              appears alone. We thus keep all the combinations documented in T-L (deci que, deci en,
              etc.) making seven appearances; the others (de ci) are the equivalent of "d'ici," for
              14 appearances.
            desor is also deceptive since des or (16 appearances), des ore (1 appearance) has
              a totally different meaning ("from now on" vs. "above" or "on top (of)"), which is
              much more frequent (57 appearances). There are a few cases in which either could be
              the form, and these are marked in the notes. Des or(e) mes is also written as three
              words, following OF (4 appearances).
            desoz/desoç appear respectively 1 and 7 times.
            aval(s) appears 12 times total: as a val once (in a combination, v. Non sta d'aler
              a val, a plagne [et] poy; otherwise it is either contrasted with amon(t) clearly (4
              times) or acts as an adverb juxtaposed to the main verb (1 time).
            amon(t) appears nine times total: four times with aval(s), otherwise alone, always
              as an adverb.
            tutor, totore, etc. are written in one word, like tuttora, Old Italian; cf.
              Treccani, Enciclopedia Dantesca); similarly for tothore (&lt; from Lat. HORA(M)).
              enfra is the Italian, not the French enfre(s)ci a (TL); cf. other Franco-Italian
              texts like the Entrée d'Espagne; Geste Francor; Guerra d'Attila, Bovo d'Antona
              Laurenziana; cf. also infra, also found in Estoires de Venise and Aquilon de
              Baviere.
          
        
        
          Some expressions in their multiplicity require one decision because of the spelling in
            this MS; for example, or endroit (12 appearances), which here we represent always as
            two words since it also appears as ore endroit (1 appearance, v. 11055); the choice
            lies between emending one form or writing all as two words. Since they are written as
            two words in the MS, we use two words. Editors have varied in their treatment of this
            form.
        
        
          Common to Franco-Italian texts is the problem of the prosthetic e- before s +
            consonant: [Discussion to follow.]
          Other prefixes are more problematic, most especially a-. [Discussion to follow.]
